<h1 title="">AMONG THE RIVER PIRATES</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">UPSTREAM</span></h2>
<p>The shabby old motor boat moved slowly up the
river towing an equally shabby old barge. Dilapidated
and unpainted as the hull was, the engine was
well muffled&mdash;suspiciously well muffled&mdash;and the disreputable
looking craft moved through the water
with all the noiseless dignity of a yacht.</p>
<p>A ferry-boat paused midway of the long tow rope
and its commuters, crowded on the forward deck,
watched this slow-moving procession with some
show of annoyance. Not a few impatient remarks
rose loud and clear above the hum of the restless
crowd, directed at the head of a man seated in the
stern of the boat, calmly puffing on a pipe. Aft on
the barge, a young boy was wrestling heroically with
the tiller, trying to keep the lumbering hulk head on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Slowly they crawled upstream. On their left
was the precipitous Jersey shore, and on their right
the towering buildings of the great city. Over the
water the late afternoon sun spread a warm, mellow
glow and touched with gold the myriad windows of
the clustering skyscrapers across the river.</p>
<p>The man knocked out his pipe with calm deliberation
and turned his wide, gray eyes to the lofty Palisades,
now bathed in a dazzling crimson. Then
slowly his glance wandered back to where the shimmering
light fell across the little shanty on the
barge and picked out in hold relief the incongruously
new and shining letters, <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>.</p>
<p>A smile lighted up his lined, weary features, a
smile of pride in ownership.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t so bad fer the old battle-axe that she is,
hey Skippy?&rdquo; he called to the boy.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s tousled head appeared from around
the battered cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say she ain&rsquo;t, Pop,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
she&rsquo;s <i>ours</i>! Gee, I can&rsquo;t believe my pop really an&rsquo;
truly owns a <i>whole</i> barge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed, then listened for a moment to
a significant sound emanating from the muffled engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there front cylinder&rsquo;s missin&rsquo; agin, Skippy,&rdquo;
he shouted. &ldquo;Loop &rsquo;er in that there ring; the tide&rsquo;s
runnin&rsquo; out now so she&rsquo;ll stand upstream. Set &rsquo;er
even &rsquo;n&rsquo; come aboard here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The boy nodded obediently and with an end of
rope fastened the old tiller to a rusty ring. Then,
hurrying forward, he jumped into the water and
grasping the taut tow line, pulled himself hand over
hand and scrambled over the stern of the launch.</p>
<p>The father put out a large, work-worn hand and
helped him in with a tenderness that was surprising
in one so rough and uncouth looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme that there shirt and them shoes while I
hang &rsquo;em near the engine,&rdquo; he said, his voice soft
with affection. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; a bad throat agin.&rdquo;
He made no demand for the boy&rsquo;s trousers, which
were the only other article of apparel that the little
fellow wore.</p>
<p>Having spread the clothing to dry and adjusted
the rebellious motor, the man returned to the stern.
He relighted his pipe and sat down with an arm
about his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll steer her fer a while, Pop,&rdquo; said Skippy.</p>
<p>For a few minutes there was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer glad we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; straight?&rdquo; the man asked
with a sudden move of his arm on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Skippy&rsquo;s eyes widened and he looked up at his
parent, hesitantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;I mean yer glad we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; straight&mdash;in a
straight racket, I mean? Now there ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be
no more worry about coppers. I won&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re
floatin&rsquo; all over the harbor an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t be worryin&rsquo;
about no pinches. A man don&rsquo;t ever think uv bein&rsquo;
pinched when his racket&rsquo;s on the up and up. An&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s me from now on. I said when I got three hunderd
saved I&rsquo;d buy a barge an&rsquo; not touch no more
shady rackets. <i>An&rsquo; I have!</i> Three hunderd&mdash;every
penny we had in the world, sonny, I paid
Josiah Flint fer the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>. She&rsquo;s worth
every dime uv it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy nodded gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;ll that help me t&rsquo; be honest when I grow up,
too,&rdquo; he asked eagerly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; be like&mdash;like a gentleman
even?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Skippy. Ain&rsquo;t that just why I saves up
an&rsquo; buys the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>? So&rsquo;s yer kin grow
up clean an&rsquo; honest like&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I done Josiah
Flint&rsquo;s dirty work fer his dirty money! So&rsquo;s I
could save an&rsquo; buy this ol&rsquo; battle-axe an&rsquo; give yer a
good an&rsquo; a clean start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re gonna carry garbage an&rsquo; ashes on
her,&rdquo; said Skippy. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t so clean exactly, is
it, Pop?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Garbage an&rsquo; ashes&rsquo;ll bring in clean money,
Skippy&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; about&mdash;clean
money. Since yer ma died I ain&rsquo;t had many real
honest like jobs. It&rsquo;s been hard ter git &rsquo;em with
yer needin&rsquo; me with yer so much counta yer bad
throat. Anyways the money come easier an&rsquo;
quicker on my jobs even if it was dirty an&rsquo; now I&rsquo;m
all through with gettin&rsquo; it shady like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; my throat&rsquo;s lots better&rsquo;n it usta be, Pop,&rdquo;
said Skippy eagerly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t had a bad one for
three months&rsquo;n over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know. Everthin&rsquo;ll be jake now with us
goin&rsquo; straight. Ol&rsquo; Flint, let him have his dirty
money an&rsquo; his fine yacht. It&rsquo;s a wonder he gets so
generous an&rsquo; sells me such a good scow fer three
hunderd smackers. Everybody says he&rsquo;s such a
money-pincher he&rsquo;d even try makin&rsquo; money on a
rusty nail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A regular miser, huh, Pop?&rdquo; said Skippy.
&ldquo;Maybe he felt sorry about you savin&rsquo; all that
money so&rsquo;s you could get a clean business. Did he
say the <i>Minnie M. Baxter&rsquo;s</i> a good barge for haulin&rsquo;
garbage an&rsquo; ashes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. He boosted her hisself when I tells him
I wants a good scow. An&rsquo; he oughta know, him that
owns more scows&rsquo;n he can count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, three hunnerd dollars&mdash;real money,&rdquo;
mused the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but not for no scow like this one. Brand
new ones cost four times that. Big Joe Tully paid
Ol&rsquo; Flint five hunderd fer his an&rsquo; Joe cleaned up
two thousand bucks on the first year. He tole me
that fer a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ain&rsquo;t Big Joe Tully doin&rsquo; sumpin&rsquo; for Mr.
Flint now?&rdquo; Skippy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Joe can&rsquo;t keep away from dirty money,&rdquo; replied
the man. &ldquo;He wants to get rich quick. Not me,
though. I can keep away from Ol&rsquo; Flint from now
on, an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, <i>I will</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I know you will, Pop,&rdquo; said the boy, with
shining eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not like&mdash;well, you&rsquo;re different
from old Mr. Flint an&rsquo; that Big Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father ran his hand over his son&rsquo;s tousled
head and gripped a handful of the straight brown
hair affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cabin ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter make us no bad little
shack, hey Skippy?&rdquo; he said nodding toward the little
square shelter aft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s swell inside&mdash;for a barge, I mean. Three
bunks an&rsquo; a nice oil stove an&rsquo; a table an&rsquo; chairs.
Gee, that&rsquo;s a regular home, huh Pop? Even there&rsquo;s
a kerosene lamp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Yer can read books an&rsquo; be nice and comfortable
in there nights. That paint job,&rdquo; he said,
scrutinizing it thoughtfully; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so fond uv that
there red, rusty color. It&rsquo;s kinda gloomy. Well, we
can repaint her sometime when we&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; money.
Blamed if that launch across stream ain&rsquo;t headin&rsquo;
straight this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the harbor inspectors, Pop. Whadja
s&rsquo;pose....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I got my license all ready, if that&rsquo;s what
they&rsquo;re after. Anyways, we ain&rsquo;t got no stuff<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
aboard, so we should worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy wondered and shivered a little. His
father&rsquo;s services in the employ of the rich, unscrupulous
Josiah Flint had brought a certain instinctive
fear of all uniformed officials and the harbor
inspectors were no exception. It was difficult
for him to believe even now that these uniformed
men meant no harm to his father.</p>
<p>Skippy had lived in the shadow of the law a little
too long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">CONDEMNED</span></h2>
<p>Skippy watched as the green, shining launch
swept alongside and stopped. He was instantly
reassured, however, when its occupants smiled
genially at him and then at his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it ain&rsquo;t Toby Dare himself,&rdquo; said one
of the men, heartily. &ldquo;Buy her lately, Dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; yesterday, Inspector Jones,&rdquo; said Skippy&rsquo;s
father, proudly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; ter put nothin&rsquo;
on her but what I&rsquo;ll be glad ter show ter anybody
what asks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Jones&rsquo; bland face became serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Joe Tully said the same thing when he
bought his scow, Dare,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t make
promises too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby Dare&rsquo;s eyes turned fondly on his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Joe Tully ain&rsquo;t got no boy like my Skippy
ter fetch up,&rdquo; he said with firm resolve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Dare,&rdquo; the inspector smiled.
&ldquo;Skippy&rsquo;s worth keeping out of trouble for. But see
that you keep him in mind when you&rsquo;re tempted.
Most o&rsquo; you birds that start a new leaf stub your
toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; said Toby vehemently. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t carin&rsquo;
ter make no quick fortune. A couple grand a
year&rsquo;ll start Skippy an&rsquo; git him educated. That&rsquo;s
all I&rsquo;m carin&rsquo; about, Inspector. <i>Me</i>, I don&rsquo;t need
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Jones beamed upon the smiling Skippy,
then casually glanced toward the barge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>, eh?&rdquo; he mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yere,&rdquo; said Toby exultantly. &ldquo;That was my
wife&rsquo;s name when she was a girl. She died when
Skippy was born. I thought mebbe the name&rsquo;d
bring me luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inspector nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any contracts lined up?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; said Toby proudly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t bad
fer a start. I&rsquo;m ter haul garbage an&rsquo; ashes from
the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Dare. Well, we&rsquo;ll look her over
and pass on her, then let you beat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby Dare looked exultantly at his son as the
trim green launch chugged off to circle the barge.
It was a look of triumph and of high hopes for the
future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;All we need&rsquo;s his O.K., Skippy,&rdquo; he said in soft
tones. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; ter be able ter face guys like
the inspector, specially when I been dodgin&rsquo; him so
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he knows you usta&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Skippy&rsquo;s tongue
seemed not to be able to say the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Toby, a little abashed. &ldquo;There
ain&rsquo;t many reg&rsquo;lars in this harbor that the inspector
ain&rsquo;t got spotted some time or other. But I should
worry now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy nodded happily and a silence ensued between
them. They listened together and watched
while the harbor launch paused midway of the <i>Minnie
M. Baxter</i> and Inspector Jones and his two subordinates
held an inaudible conference. Then for a
time they made soundings after which the inspector
boarded the barge and spent another five minutes
inspecting it fore and aft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more ter this here inspectin&rsquo; business
than what a guy thinks,&rdquo; said Toby simply. &ldquo;All I
know uv boats is this here kicker. I never did
more&rsquo;n load an&rsquo; unload aboard Ol&rsquo; Flint&rsquo;s scows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inspector&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; back in the launch,&rdquo; said
Skippy eagerly. &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;ll come back an&rsquo; say
it&rsquo;s all right an&rsquo; then we can go, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Toby Dare nodded and smilingly waited as
the launch chugged back alongside of his kicker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What yer think uv my ol&rsquo; battle-axe, hey, Inspector?&rdquo;
he asked, chuckling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Battle-axe is a good word for her, Dare,&rdquo; said
the inspector solemnly. &ldquo;Nothing describes her
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby Dare&rsquo;s generous mouth seemed to tighten
at the corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What yer mean, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did you pay for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hunderd&mdash;why?&rdquo; Toby&rsquo;s lips trembled a
little and he searched the inspector&rsquo;s face anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d you buy her from?&rdquo; the inspector persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Flint! Josiah Flint,&rdquo; Toby answered suspiciously.
&ldquo;<i>Why?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it must be somebody like him. I hate
to spring it on you, Dare, but you&rsquo;ve paid three hundred
dollars too much. She&rsquo;s not worth a dime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby Dare cleared his throat and a strange look
came into his kindly gray eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector &mdash;&mdash;, yer mean this here barge ain&rsquo;t....&rdquo;
he began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not seaworthy,&rdquo; the inspector interposed
as kindly as he could. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe to keep her
afloat, Dare. Flint gypped you. You should
have had somebody look her over before you
bought her&mdash;somebody that knew an up-and-coming
barge from driftwood. That&rsquo;s all you got on your
hands, I&rsquo;m sorry to say&mdash;<i>driftwood</i>. Her keel&rsquo;s as
rotten as a keel can possibly be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby Dare&rsquo;s tanned, weather-beaten face went
suddenly white and he made a funny little clicking
noise with his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The keel,&rdquo; he muttered hoarsely, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t I have
&rsquo;er fixed, Inspector&mdash;<i>can&rsquo;t I</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Jones shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d take more money than what you paid for
the old hulk, Dare; more money than you&rsquo;ve got, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got a cent, Inspector, that&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo;
Toby said, choking on his words. &ldquo;Every cent I
had I paid Ol&rsquo; Flint an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Jones leaned toward the miserable man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take on so, Dare. Maybe the thing&rsquo;s not
as hopeless as it seems. If Josiah Flint&rsquo;s got a
spark of human feeling he&rsquo;ll make good. Perhaps
he didn&rsquo;t realize what shape the barge was in when
he sold her. He owns so many....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest it, Inspector,&rdquo; said Toby, clenching
his calloused hands. &ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Flint <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> got human
feelin&rsquo;. I worked fer him an&rsquo; I know. An&rsquo; fer a
big ship-owner like him, he knows every craft he
owns like a book. Now that I think uv it, I know
he knew what he was sellin&rsquo; me! He knew I was
dumb about them things an&rsquo; he took advantage uv
it.&rdquo; Dare looked down the harbor, glowing in the
sunset, and his jaw was set determinedly. &ldquo;He
smiled, Ol&rsquo; Flint did, when I forked over my jack.
He knew all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy&rsquo;s eyes were misty and he looked appealingly
at Inspector Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean Pop can&rsquo;t use the <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i>?&rdquo; he faltered.</p>
<p>The inspector averted his face from the boy&rsquo;s
pleading eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think you can&rsquo;t appeal to Flint personally,
Dare,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sue him. A lawyer&rsquo;ll make
him kick in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from Ol&rsquo; Flint,&rdquo; said Toby Dare hoarsely
and looking straight across the river. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too
rich ter be sued. But there&rsquo;s one way uv fixin&rsquo; him&mdash;<i>one
way</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Jones motioned his men to start their
craft on its way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; he said, glancing quickly from father
to son. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a break yet. The safest way
to get after Flint, Toby, is to sue him. You&rsquo;d certainly
not get anywhere with him the way you feel
now. Meanwhile, the safest place for the scow is
up at the Basin. She&rsquo;s just not safe even to be
towed around the harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy watched the long line of foam that the
launch left in its wake. For a long time his misty
eyes were fastened on the glistening bubbles dancing
atop the water until he could no longer stand
his father&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop, Pop,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we go&mdash;go
somewhere now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;sure,&rdquo; said Toby brokenly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;
somewheres a&rsquo;right. We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; ter the Basin
where Jones told us to go with the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>.&rdquo;
He laughed sardonically. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; ter
put the ol&rsquo; battle-axe in dry-dock <i>forever</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that mean, Pop?&rdquo; Skippy asked pathetically.
&ldquo;It sounds like you mean something
terrible will happen to the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> terrible ter me&mdash;an&rsquo; ter you, Skippy boy,&rdquo;
mumbled Toby. &ldquo;It means that the pore scow&rsquo;s so
rotten she ain&rsquo;t fit fer nothin&rsquo; but ter be put high
an&rsquo; dry in Brown&rsquo;s Basin along with half a hunderd
other rotten scows. It&rsquo;s way in the inlet an&rsquo; folks
live in them scows like I guess you an&rsquo; me&rsquo;ll have ter
till I kin think what next.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then all those other barges like ours can never
sail the harbor again, huh?&rdquo; Skippy asked sadly.
&ldquo;They just sorta stay there till they rot an&rsquo; fall
apart, is that it? Like as if they&rsquo;re condemned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the word, Skippy,&rdquo; said Toby Dare bitterly.
&ldquo;The <i>Minnie M. Baxter&rsquo;s</i> been condemned
an&rsquo; you an&rsquo; me are condemned along with her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">THE BASIN</span></h2>
<p>Brown&rsquo;s Basin was off the beaten track, even
nautically speaking. One could never have found
it except by the merest chance, unless one were fortunate
enough to have a companion who was familiar
with it. The rivermen knew, perhaps knew
too well, as did the police who preferred to get no
closer to the colony than the shadowy inlet which
sulks silently in the daylight hours and strangely
springs to life under cover of the blackest nights.</p>
<p>The Basin, as it is more familiarly known, thrives
under the protection of the lofty Palisades. In
summer the foliage all but hides it from the shore,
and in winter the grim, gray rocks give it ample security
from the prying eyes of the world. And the
Basin wishes that security, for the character of the
residents is such that secrecy and isolation provide
the means for their livelihood and their existence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Perhaps half a hundred derelict barges dot the
slimy mud banks of the Basin, some of them occupied
and some not. But on the whole the combined
population of this sordid looking place represents a
fair number and on bright, sunlit mornings one can
get an occasional glimpse from the steep river road
of poorly clad children scrambling from one to the
other of the closely packed barges, much the same
as they would scramble across city streets.</p>
<p>Large planks connect the sprawling hulks in a sort
of interminable chain and the denizens can traverse
the entire settlement by this means. More often
than not the family laundry waving in the damp
river breeze on the forward deck must be dodged
by this strolling citizenry, but they are quite used to
all forms of adroit evasion, particularly where the
law is concerned.</p>
<p>It was into this little lawless colony that the <i>Minnie
M. Baxter</i> was towed. Sunset had long since
gone, leaving but a hint of vermilion colored sky at
the horizon as the kicker chugged silently farther
and farther into the muddy waters of the inlet.
Skippy steered the motor-boat and Toby Dare
struggled at the tiller of the barge while most of
the colonists looked on indifferently. They
sprawled about on the various decks, men, women
and children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Criticism, both friendly and otherwise, reached
Toby Dare&rsquo;s sensitive ears, but he paid little heed,
using his own judgment as to a suitable spot in which
to rest the ill-fated barge. It was a spot at the
very edge of the Basin that he chose and so manifest
was its isolation from the rest of the colony
that but one inference could be drawn: Toby Dare
did not intend his son or himself to be drawn into
that maelstrom of dubious citizenry. His grief
over the recent misfortune in no way blunted his
keen senses and, as always, Skippy&rsquo;s future welfare
was uppermost in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re people what ain&rsquo;t partic&rsquo;lar &rsquo;bout things,
Sonny,&rdquo; he explained while the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>
was settling in the mud. &ldquo;They&mdash;well, they can&rsquo;t
help it, but they&rsquo;re folks what ain&rsquo;t carin&rsquo; whether
their boys is fetched up right or not. They jest let
their kids live day after day sorta an&rsquo; they don&rsquo;t
think uv next year. Me, I&rsquo;m always a-thinkin&rsquo;
&rsquo;bout you a year ahead&mdash;see? So it ain&rsquo;t no use
botherin&rsquo; with folks what thinks different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, Pop,&rdquo; said Skippy looking musingly into
the rust-colored water. &ldquo;You know all about &rsquo;em,
huh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;n they know themselves, Sonny. Ain&rsquo;t
they slaves fer Ol&rsquo; Flint same as I was? Only I
did more uv his high class dirty work. I overseed
&rsquo;em load an&rsquo; unload the stuff fer Ol&rsquo; Flint an&rsquo; it paid
enough ter keep my sonny in a shack ashore where
he didn&rsquo;t see his Pop helpin&rsquo; ter beat the law. Now
when I thought I was through with that an&rsquo; ready
ter give yer a clean, honest start&mdash;<i>where am I?</i>&rdquo;
He buried his face in his hands.</p>
<p>Skippy touched his father on the shoulder with a
trembling hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, Pop&mdash;forget it, huh? I can help soon too,
can&rsquo;t I? When I get my workin&rsquo; papers I can. I&rsquo;ll
even go to night school an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be honest an&rsquo; like a
gentleman just the same as if the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>
wasn&rsquo;t condemned an&rsquo; we could haul garbage an&rsquo;
ashes an&rsquo; make plenty.&rdquo; He was quite exhausted
by this lengthy declaration but his eyes were full of
shining hope.</p>
<p>Toby Dare raised his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yer a-meanin&rsquo; well, Sonny, but yer ain&rsquo;t got no
idea how hard it is ter do anythin&rsquo; without a little
money. Besides, it sort uv taints a man&rsquo;s own
fam&rsquo;ly even, when he&rsquo;s worked fer Ol&rsquo; Flint.
Decent, honest shipowners give a man the go-by
when they find out yer been a Flint man. Yer blackballed,
in other words, Sonny&mdash;see? Yer ain&rsquo;t given
no chance ter work at an honest job no matter how
bad yer want to. An&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; but river
work an&rsquo; the like&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t never done nothin&rsquo; else!
The only thing fer a man like me ter do was ter try
an&rsquo; go on his own hook like I meant ter do with the
<i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>. Now I can&rsquo;t do that unless&mdash;unless....&rdquo;
His large, yellow teeth seemed to
close over the word hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what, Pop?&rdquo; Skippy asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I kin make him give me back my money
an&rsquo; I kin buy another <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>.&rdquo; He
choked a little and shook his disheveled head. &ldquo;But
that&rsquo;s too much ter hope fer, Skippy. Ol&rsquo; Flint&rsquo;s
never been known ter give anythin&rsquo; back&mdash;it&rsquo;s me
that oughta know that. I was a fool ter think he
could be honest with me&mdash;<i>me</i>, a poor workman uv
his. Why, Ol&rsquo; Flint&rsquo;s bragged he&rsquo;d skin anybody
what was fool enough ter <i>be</i> skinned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy shifted uncomfortably from one foot to
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So then will you go to a lawyer like Inspector
Jones told you? To please me, Pop, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; nowheres but ter see Ol&rsquo; Flint,&rdquo; answered
Toby hoarsely. &ldquo;That swell yacht uv his
is anchored in the bay an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; aboard it durin&rsquo;
this hot spell so I know where ter find him after
workin&rsquo; hours. He ain&rsquo;t only ten years older &rsquo;n me
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s in good condition an&rsquo; jest my size so....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pop&mdash;Pop, you got fight on your mind an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
just the way Inspector Jones warned you not to go
to see Mr. Flint! Besides, it ain&rsquo;t gonna be half
bad here till we can think up sumpin&rsquo; else to do.
Forget about Mr. Flint if you&rsquo;re jus&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; of him
on accounta me. I&rsquo;ll be all right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forget anythin&rsquo; &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; that Ol&rsquo; Flint&rsquo;s
cheated me with a grin on his slick face,&rdquo; said Toby
Dare with an ominous softness in his voice. &ldquo;So
I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; ter teach him a lesson, Skippy&mdash;I&rsquo;m
a-goin&rsquo; ter teach him that Toby Dare can&rsquo;t be
cheated outa everythin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s hoped fer, fer years,
without hittin&rsquo; back. Yessir, Ol&rsquo; Flint&rsquo;s gotta learn
what it means ter cheat me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop&mdash;Pop! You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;&mdash;honest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; sure as guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When&mdash;when you goin&rsquo;, Pop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tonight!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">COMPROMISE</span></h2>
<p>Skippy got the first meal aboard the <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i>. His heart and soul were certainly not in
the task for he burned four of the flapjacks that he
was cooking. The coffee had twice boiled over and
the narrow little cabin was filled with a blue, acrid
smoke and though the sight of his father&rsquo;s lugubrious
face, as he paced up and down outside the little
windows, disturbed him, he was not particularly unhappy.</p>
<p>His mind, during the preparation of that meal,
was not on his father&rsquo;s misfortunes nor on the
threatened and ominous visit to the Flint yacht that
very evening. Instead he was visualizing what
benefits were to be derived from residing in the
Basin, chief among these being an uninterrupted
summer season of fishing and swimming. That to
the heart of a boy of his age compensated fully for
the loss of the garbage and ashes contract, yes, even
for the loss of the barge&rsquo;s promise of a remunerative future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>It is not to be thought that Skippy did not deeply
feel his father&rsquo;s grief, for indeed he had brooded
over it for hours. But after they had settled and
arranged their few belongings in the meagerly furnished
cabin of the barge, he had achieved that
blessed miracle of youth and accepted the inevitable
without a question. Life stretched out ahead of
him as the inlet lay spread under this starlit night,
broken now and then by a quiet ripple until it
reached the river. What would happen beyond
that point he knew he could find out when he came
to it.</p>
<p>And so, more contented than his brooding and
troubled parent, Skippy piled up the flapjacks until
they resembled the leaning tower of Pisa, and he
whistled to the accompaniment of the sputtering
coffee pot. All the world seemed delightful and
generous with these savory dishes ready to be eaten,
and he asked himself if his father wasn&rsquo;t making
much of little. After all, they had the <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i> for a home, didn&rsquo;t they? And wasn&rsquo;t living
on a barge just the kind of life that he and his
pals had often wished for when they had lain about
their dusty dooryards on hot summer nights?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The boy ran to the door, his tanned face flushed
and expectant. He would tell his father how much
better he was going to feel out on the river all summer
than back in dusty, hot Riverboro where he had
spent all his life. He would fish and swim and take
lots of deep, lung-developing breaths. He&rsquo;d probably
never have another bad throat....</p>
<p>He inhaled deeply on the strength of this thought
and though his lungs filled with a queerly mixed odor
of mud, decayed fish and salt, he noticed it not at
all. Moreover, the inlet might have been a clear,
wind-swept ocean waste, so far above the Basin had
his imagination carried him.</p>
<p>A figure stirred in the shadows forward and then
he heard the familiar tread of his father. Suddenly
on the damp salt breeze they heard the distant
sound of chimes and waited silently while the faint
notes struck off the hour of ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty late to eat, huh Pop? Everythin&rsquo;s ready,
so you better come while it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yer know where them chimes come from?&rdquo;
Toby asked in a tone of voice that was strange to
his son. &ldquo;They come from River Heights on that
swell Town Hall what Ol&rsquo; Flint give to the borough.
Now I s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;ll give the three hunderd dollars he
cheated me outa, fer somethin&rsquo; else what&rsquo;ll give him
a big name, hey? That&rsquo;s what some uv them
scoundrels like Ol&rsquo; Flint do&mdash;give their dirty money
ter things what&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em a fine big name. Well,
he won&rsquo;t git the chanct ter give my three hunderd&mdash;not
while I live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josiah Flint again! Skippy&rsquo;s heart lost all its
merry hopes in a fleeting second. He turned back
into the cabin and his father followed him in
gloomy silence. Mechanically, he carried the
steaming plate from the oil stove to the rickety little
oil-cloth covered table and without a word they
pulled up their chairs and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never tole yer before,&rdquo; said Toby after a few
moments, &ldquo;but if it wasn&rsquo;t fer Ol&rsquo; Flint there
wouldn&rsquo; never &rsquo;a&rsquo; been no squatter colony like this
in Brown&rsquo;s Basin. It&rsquo;s him what&rsquo;s made it, that&rsquo;s
what. They&rsquo;re all blackballed men, Sonny; men
what&rsquo;s got in Ol&rsquo; Flint&rsquo;s clutches an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t never got
the chance nor the brains ter git out. Not like me
that had a little more brains ter earn bigger money
so&rsquo;s I could save fer the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>. <i>Save!</i>&rdquo;
He brought his fist down upon the table with such
force that a flapjack bounced from his plate to the
floor. &ldquo;Ha, ha&mdash;what for did I save, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed so sardonically that Skippy hurried
for the coffee to hide his concern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, please don&rsquo;t take on so, Pop!&rdquo; His eyes
were directed at Toby&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Gee, that old
miser, he ain&rsquo;t worth you actin&rsquo; so queer an&rsquo; all. It
ain&rsquo;t so bad here. It&rsquo;s a nice little house we got in
this cabin; chairs an&rsquo; the stove an&rsquo; a table an&rsquo; our
trunk.&rdquo; His glance wandered to the tiny windows
opened to the damp salt breeze. &ldquo;Even I bet I
could put up some cretonne stuff as good as a girl
an&rsquo; then won&rsquo;t this be one nice-lookin&rsquo; little place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby&rsquo;s chair scraped over the rough, clean
boards and he stood up, straight and powerful and
ominous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the coffee now,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
&ldquo;We kin heat it up an&rsquo; drink it when we come back.&rdquo;
He laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drink it as a toast ter Ol&rsquo;
Flint&rsquo;s health!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy put down the coffee pot and wiped his
grimy hands on his khaki knickers. Then with a
swift movement he shook back his straight, rebellious
hair and glanced up at his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you mean you want me with you, Pop?&rdquo;
he asked tremulously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Jest</i> what I mean, Skippy. I want yer along
so&rsquo;s I kin remember Ol&rsquo; Flint ain&rsquo;t worth ... well,
what I mean is, if I have yer to talk ter on the way
I ain&rsquo;t so like ter lose my head when I git there an&rsquo;
talk ter him. If he gits sneerin&rsquo; at me like his habit
is mostly, it&rsquo;ll be good fer me ter know my Sonny&rsquo;s
right outside a-waitin&rsquo; in the kicker. Waitin&rsquo; fer
his Pop, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure,&rdquo; Skippy gulped. &ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll go with
you if it&rsquo;s gonna make you feel that way, Pop. Gee,
I&rsquo;ll go anywheres with you if you only promise not
to lose your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest the sight uv that man&rsquo;ll make me lose my
head, Skippy&mdash;I know it. But so long as yer make
me promise&mdash;I won&rsquo;t give him the worst uv it, if I
kin help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy knew his father well enough to accept just
that much and hope for the best. He went to the
old battered trunk, took out a worn sweater and
while still drawing it on followed Toby outside.</p>
<p>They descended the rope ladder in silence and got
into the shabby boat. Toby turned over the motor
and Skippy took his place at the bow to watch for
drifting logs for the little kicker had not a light.
Toby&rsquo;s former nocturnal occupations had made it
necessary for him to dispense with this appurtenance
and now, as he explained to his inquiring son, it had
become a habit to roam the river without illumination,
knowing as he did every square foot of it. Besides,
he had come to love the solitude of darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Skippy looked all about him, not exactly at his
ease. The inlet was black and at times the starlit
sky seemed so far away as to be but a mirage. Perhaps
there wasn&rsquo;t a star in all the heavens, he would
try to tell himself. All was black night and the
muffled motor purred with a hushed monotony that
affected him strangely. He fervently hoped that
they would not be long in reaching the river where
he could breathe without feeling that he was going
to choke.</p>
<p>He knew he was afraid and he knew it really had
nothing to do with the inlet or the black, silent night.
It was a nameless dread that had seized him and,
try as he would, he could not shake it off.</p>
<p>Instinctively, he felt that they shouldn&rsquo;t go on to
Josiah Flint&rsquo;s yacht that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">THE APOLLYON</span></h2>
<p>Skippy felt better when the boat nosed out into
the river. He raised his worried face to the clear
salt breeze and let it blow over his hot cheeks.
Lights blinked here and there on the dark water
and a tug chortled by noisily. Then on the far
shore he saw a cable light, and a ship ran clear of it
before she dropped her mooring anchor.</p>
<p>Toby said nothing but sat in a lugubrious silence
as he steered the little craft downstream. Skippy
stared hard at the spray foaming against the bow;
his mind was not on drifting logs. He turned to
his father, scanned his face anxiously, then peered
downstream again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Flint&rsquo;s yacht much further, Pop?&rdquo; he
asked after a few minutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, we oughta soon be on top uv her,&rdquo; came the
hoarse reply. &ldquo;Yer can&rsquo;t miss her&mdash;she&rsquo;s got her
name sprawled fore an&rsquo; aft in great big gold letters.
It&rsquo;s some fancy name called A&mdash;Apollyon. That&rsquo;s
it. Kindo highfalutin name, hey? Like all them
there Flints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many Flints are there, Pop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest two now, like me an&rsquo; you. Ol&rsquo; Flint an&rsquo; his
son, Buck. His real name&rsquo;s Harry. Anyway folks
call him Buck. But he&rsquo;s got it better&rsquo;n you, Sonny.
Much better. Besides he&rsquo;s old enough ter take his
father&rsquo;s place in the dirty business, though I heerd
not so long ago that Buck ain&rsquo;t uv a mind with the
old man an&rsquo; lets Marty Skinner help run the works.
They say Buck&rsquo;s terrible honest an&rsquo; all fer the law
but Skinner&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but a rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe Buck&rsquo;ll take over his father&rsquo;s business
some day and make it pay without havin&rsquo; smugglin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; things like that, huh Pop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe, but not if that crook Skinner keeps his
ball in the game. Still, I heerd it said that Ol&rsquo;
Flint&rsquo;s business has always paid good enough without
him doin&rsquo; dirty work fer easy money. But
that&rsquo;s what a miser he is&mdash;he&rsquo;s gotta have a crooked
side line so&rsquo;s ter pile up his millions in a coupla
years. He ain&rsquo;t willin&rsquo; like the rest uv these shipowners
&rsquo;round here ter wait an&rsquo; let a honest fortune
pile up, say, in twenty years or so. He can&rsquo;t be
honest, Ol&rsquo; Flint can&rsquo;t, not even with a poor man
like me, an&rsquo; Skinner&rsquo;s the same breed uv cats.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>They were approaching a wide bend in the river.
Anchored launches and trim sailboats dotted the
shadowy water like immaculate sentinels. Skippy&rsquo;s
restless eyes roved over the silent scene until he
espied the graceful sweep of a yacht&rsquo;s bow projecting
out of the shadows into the line of its anchor
light. Simultaneously he saw great gold letters
spelling out the name <i>Apollyon</i> and it occurred to
him how modest and neat was the brass lettering of
the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> in contrast.</p>
<p>The white, dainty craft swayed ever so gently on
the slight swell and Skippy was lost in envy. He
bethought himself of the sprawling uncouth barge
and for a moment wondered why things were like
this; why a man of Josiah Flint&rsquo;s sort could own this
dainty, spotless yacht while his father who wanted
so much to be honest had not even the worth of the
hard-earned barge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>For the first time, he understood how bitter and
revengeful his father must feel. He too felt bitter
and revengeful as they got closer to the <i>Apollyon</i>.
Something began to smolder in his boy&rsquo;s heart;
something wholly alien to his cheerful, wholesome
nature. But he was aware of nothing of this, save
that he felt like sneering aloud at this proud, complacent
craft swaying before his eyes. In a wild
fancy he imagined her to be mocking his father and
himself for daring to hope that Josiah Flint would
make restitution.</p>
<p>A dim light shone amidships and save for the
anchor lights the rest of the yacht was in darkness.
Skippy stared hard at her and suddenly saw something
skimming away from her port side.</p>
<p>He leaned far over the prow of the little motor
boat until he saw that the object was a kicker like
their own with its engine muffled. In whispered
words he drew Toby&rsquo;s attention to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where she&rsquo;s been and where she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to, huh Pop?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t none uv our business, Skippy,&rdquo; his
father answered staring up at the <i>Apollyon</i>.
&ldquo;Folks on the river don&rsquo;t think uv them things this
time uv night. They know a muffled engine&rsquo;s one
that ain&rsquo;t carin&rsquo; ter be heard, same as I got one fer
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could have ours taken off now, huh Pop?
It ain&rsquo;t any more use now, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all depends, Sonny. It all depends on Ol&rsquo;
Flint,&rdquo; Toby said softly. &ldquo;Now here we are an&rsquo;
the less said, the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy!&rdquo; called a voice in deep, soft tones from
above. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s below?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Father and son glanced up to see the head and
shoulders of a burly man leaning over the glistening
rail. Skippy saw Toby stiffen determinedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Flint aboard?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; the man answered suppressing a yawn.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his cabin amidships. Lookin&rsquo; for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move the kicker aft an&rsquo; come aboard. Old
man was talkin&rsquo; with Mr. Skinner when I come on
duty two hours ago. His light&rsquo;s still on so he&rsquo;s
readin&rsquo; likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boat moved aft with hardly a splash
and the next moment Toby was scrambling up the
ladder. Skippy listened intently as his father set
foot on the <i>Apollyon&rsquo;s</i> deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to tell him he&rsquo;s got a caller?&rdquo; the man
suddenly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. Thanks jest the same,&rdquo; Toby was saying.
&ldquo;I even got half an idee that mebbe he expects
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awright, buddy,&rdquo; said the man heartily.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find him &rsquo;midships like I told you. There
where the little light is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Skippy heard the soft tread of his father&rsquo;s step
along the deck. A door closed and after an interval
of silence he looked up to see that the man was
still there, bending over the rail and apparently staring
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Dad, hey kid?&rdquo; he asked, catching Skippy&rsquo;s
upturned eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Pop,&rdquo; Skippy corrected, chuckling. He
liked the man&rsquo;s hearty voice. &ldquo;You work aboard
this yacht, Mister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second mate, that&rsquo;s what. Easy job summers
when the old man&rsquo;s busy. All we do is to sleep and
keep the old girl ship-shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, this scow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some scow!&rdquo; Skippy laughed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty
swell, I&rsquo;ll say. Not much trouble keepin&rsquo; <i>her</i> ship-shape,
huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw. There ain&rsquo;t enough to keep us busy an&rsquo;
it makes a swab lazy. Same&rsquo;s me tonight. Here
I am the only one on duty (there ain&rsquo;t no need for
more&rsquo;n one, anchored here like we are) and things
are so quiet what do I do but fall sound asleep!
I&rsquo;d sat me down and I hear the old man bawlin&rsquo; Mr.
Skinner out fierce. Then I guess I was dozin&rsquo; a
spell &rsquo;fore I heard the sound of a muffled motor aft.
Dreamed it, I guess, and I dreamed I heard somebody
comin&rsquo; out from the boss&rsquo;s quarters &rsquo;midships.
Anyways, I finally woke up and when I come to the
rail I see you folks. Guess that&rsquo;s what I was hearin&rsquo;
in my dreams all the time, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Skippy. &ldquo;Our motor&rsquo;s muffled, I
guess you noticed already, but you might &rsquo;a&rsquo; heard
another kicker like ours too because one was aft
when we came along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess maybe that&rsquo;s what it was then,&rdquo; said the
second mate pleasantly. &ldquo;Just somebody bein&rsquo; a
little cautious, like. Still I got to quit bein&rsquo; so lazy
nights and do my duty by <i>Polly</i> like the old man
pays me for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Polly?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second mate laughed softly and Skippy
fancied that his mischievous wink penetrated the
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Apollyon</i>&mdash;<i>Polly</i> for short, kid! <i>Apollyon</i> is
too highfalutin for able seamen, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought, Mister. I never heard
it before. Gee whiz, what&rsquo;s it mean anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second mate paused a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I could make out from the Cap&rsquo;n it
was the name of a Greek story or somethin&rsquo;. You
know&mdash;one of them real old Greeks thousands of
years back. And this <i>Apollyon</i> was a evil spirit or
somethin&rsquo; like that, and folks called &rsquo;im the Destroyer!
Ain&rsquo;t that a name for you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Skippy nodded and looked at the graceful ship
with a new interest. Evil spirit? Destroyer? A
queer name indeed for such a dainty craft. Why
should Josiah Flint give that beautiful hull such an
evil name? The sound of a dull thump interrupted
his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t work on a ship with a name like that,&rdquo;
he said to the second mate at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; the man laughed. &ldquo;Superstitious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Skippy answered seriously.
&ldquo;At least I never thought I was sup-super-superstitious
more&rsquo;n most kids. But it don&rsquo;t seem exactly
fair callin&rsquo; a nice ship like that the destroyer
or an evil spirit or whatever <i>Apollyon</i> really means.
Gee, I&rsquo;ve heard my Pop say that a ship kinda gets
lookin&rsquo; like its name an&rsquo; actin&rsquo; like its name after a
while. That&rsquo;s why he named the barge he bought
from Mr. Flint after my mother; the <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i> she&rsquo;s called. He said she&rsquo;d be the nicest
barge on the river if she took after my mother.
But so far it ain&rsquo;t worked out,&rdquo; he added wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; the second mate inquired sympathetically.</p>
<p>Skippy summed up the whole story of his father&rsquo;s
misfortune in a few words. Particularly did he
stress Toby&rsquo;s grief over Josiah Flint&rsquo;s wilful deception
in the transaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;And so your Pop&rsquo;s come to make the old man
come across, hey? Well, I don&rsquo;t blame him.&rdquo; The
man lowered his voice to a mere whisper. &ldquo;I only
hope he don&rsquo;t get the boss in a nasty temper &rsquo;cause
he&rsquo;s not one to give in and he sounded like he was
good and sore when he was bawlin&rsquo; out Mr. Skinner.
Besides, he ain&rsquo;t the one to admit he cheated
your pop either. Still....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low moan startled them both and suddenly a
door slammed, followed by the sound of someone
running along the deck. Skippy stood straight up
in the motor boat and listened intently.</p>
<p>He knew those footsteps and he knew what was
in the mind that directed them with such force.
His father never hurried, much less ran, unless he
was terribly angered or pained or....</p>
<p>He dared not complete that thought, nor did he
have need to, for his father&rsquo;s drawn, white face was
already looking down at him from above the rail
and Skippy read there all that he needed to know.</p>
<p>Something terrible had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">A STRANGE STORY</span></h2>
<p>The little motor boat had left the <i>Apollyon</i> far
behind, ignoring shouts from its deck to halt, before
Skippy dared break the tense silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, Pop,&rdquo; he stammered fearfully, &ldquo;what happened
between you and Mr. Flint anyway, huh?
Because you didn&rsquo;t even say goodnight to the mate
an&rsquo; you got in the boat an&rsquo; told me so cranky an&rsquo;
all to push off before I got a chance to say goodnight
to him, either&mdash;gee whiz! I never seen you
act so funny before in my life. What&rsquo;s the matter,
huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby Dare groaned and buried his face between
his hands. Then, for what seemed to Skippy an
interminable time, he rocked to and fro and the
groans that escaped him were distressing to the
waiting boy.</p>
<p>Finally Skippy could stand it no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop, you gotta tell me what&rsquo;s the matter! Gee,
it&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; terrible the way....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sonny,&rdquo; Toby interposed brokenly, &ldquo;git back ter
the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> jest as quick as yer kin! I
got ter put as much water between me&mdash;me an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;
<i>him</i> as it&rsquo;s possible ter put.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a dream, Sonny&mdash;a bad dream&mdash;a terrible
dream. I can&rsquo;t make head or tail uv it yet.
I went ter his cabin &rsquo;midships like that mate told
me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Skippy encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knocked on the door an&rsquo; I could uv sworn I
heard a kinda grunt like Ol&rsquo; Flint does. He&rsquo;s a
man uv few words. Anyways, I goes in an&rsquo; there
he&rsquo;s sittin&rsquo; in a big chair with a funny grin on his
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grinnin&rsquo; at <i>you</i>, Pop?&rdquo; Skippy asked clenching
his straight white teeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought an&rsquo; right away I got
wild,&rdquo; Toby answered running his hands nervously
through his disheveled hair. &ldquo;I forgot what I
promised&mdash;I forgot everythin&rsquo; &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; the way he&rsquo;d
cheated me an&rsquo; I got tellin&rsquo; him so but he didn&rsquo;t say
nothin&rsquo;, but jest kep&rsquo; sittin&rsquo; there a-grinnin&rsquo; that
funny way. Well, I knowed as how he always was
a man uv few words but I thought he could stop
grinnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; at least say <i>somethin&rsquo;</i>. But he didn&rsquo;
an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what made me see red&mdash;I thought he was
a-makin&rsquo; fun uv me, sorta, an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go for him?&rdquo; Skippy interposed fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sonny, I jest sorta lost my head,&rdquo; answered
Toby brokenly. &ldquo;I kin hardly remember what happened
&rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; I realized all uv a sudden that I had
my hands &rsquo;round his throat an&rsquo; I was chokin&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t he make any noise or anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
Skippy was horrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what made me let go. I got wise right
then that somethin&rsquo; was funny &rsquo;cause he didn&rsquo;t let a
sound outa him all the time. His eyes seemed ter
git funnier lookin&rsquo; though, but he kep&rsquo; on grinnin&rsquo;
jest the same. Then I let go quick an&rsquo; <i>plop</i>&mdash;over
he fell, head first he fell an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s when I saw
it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he&rsquo;d been shot in the back,&rdquo; Toby whispered
looking about uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pop!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure as guns, Skippy,&rdquo; Toby moaned pitifully.
&ldquo;Then I knew he musta been dead all the time&mdash;even
before I got in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy too groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how could he sit up like that then, if he
really was <i>dead</i>?&rdquo; he asked with an audible gulp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been wonderin&rsquo; an&rsquo; all I kin
think is that whoever did it, sat him up that way
after it happened. I could see in his bedroom off
uv the room he was sittin&rsquo; in an&rsquo; papers was lyin&rsquo; all
&rsquo;round like as if there&rsquo;d been a scrap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With somebody else,&rdquo; Skippy murmured as if to
himself. Then, in a frightened whisper: &ldquo;What
then, Pop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I could do was stand there like a crazy
man,&rdquo; Toby groaned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even remember
how long I stood there. It&rsquo;s all like part uv that
nightmare so I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Pop.&rdquo; Skippy tried to sound comforting.
&ldquo;Who&mdash;what groaned that time? The second
mate and me heard it plain&rsquo;s anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me. That was when I knew he was dead! It
jest sorta come ter me full in the face an&rsquo; I was
so full uv fright that I had ter let it out some
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy turned around and for a few moments
searched the face of his unhappy father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pop&mdash;Pop,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;just one thing I can&rsquo;t
understand&mdash;why&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t you tell the second
mate, an&rsquo; me, right then? Why&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t you
spurt it right out an&rsquo; not run away when you know
you didn&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d believe it?&rdquo; Toby answered hopelessly.
&ldquo;There was the mark uv my fingers on his throat&mdash;<i>there
they was</i>! I&rsquo;d even have ter admit ter that
mate that I was mad enough ter choke Ol&rsquo; Flint ter
death&mdash;he could see my fingers there ter prove it,
couldn&rsquo;t he? Well, why wouldn&rsquo;t he think I give
him an automatic in the back afterwards, hey?
Why wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>But, Pop!</i> If you only had said <i>sumpin</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted ter git away from that awful grinnin&rsquo;
face. As far away as I c&rsquo;d get. I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t stay
there ter tell nobody <i>nothin&rsquo;</i>, Skippy. Besides, do
I know I didn&rsquo;t choke him ter&mdash;ter...&rdquo; He
sobbed a moment, then looked up. &ldquo;Mebbe
&rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t the automatic what really got him, Skippy&mdash;mebbe
&rsquo;twas <i>me</i>, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy reached out and grasped Toby&rsquo;s damp
flannel shirt sleeve in agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop, it wasn&rsquo;t you&mdash;I know it&mdash;<i>I just feel it</i>!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;I can tell from all you told me about
him grinnin&rsquo; like from the time you got inside the
room.&rdquo; He hesitated a moment, then: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
remember him makin&rsquo; a sound at all?&rdquo; he asked,
anxiously peering into his father&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not one sol&rsquo;tary sound, Sonny&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t hear a
one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy sighed and again took up the task of steering
the little motor boat upstream. His tired
young face, however, had taken on a new look of
resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired, Pop, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m gonna take you back
to the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>. Then I&rsquo;m gonna turn
this kicker straight back and head her downstream
again an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; aboard that <i>Apollyon</i> an&rsquo; explain
the whole thing. I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;em everythin&rsquo; like
you told me an&rsquo; I bet they&rsquo;ll believe it all right
&rsquo;cause they&rsquo;ll see that my Pop couldn&rsquo;t kill anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby said nothing but continued to rock back and
forth with his head in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;maybe you&rsquo;re not so tired an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d
turn &rsquo;round with me an&rsquo; go back an&rsquo; tell &rsquo;em, huh
Pop?&rdquo; Skippy returned anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skippy,&rdquo; Toby cried hoarsely, &ldquo;jest now I wanta
go back ter the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> an&rsquo; think. Like
a good boy don&rsquo;t talk about it no more till we get
there, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Skippy, bewildered, promised that he wouldn&rsquo;t,
and let the little kicker out to the best of her ability.
From time to time he heard the miserable sighs of
his father, and over and over again he told himself
the story of Josiah Flint&rsquo;s strange death just as
Toby had told it. But with each recurring
thought, a strange suspicion asserted itself and
clamored so hard in the boy&rsquo;s conscious mind that he
was forced to recognize that it was a doubt, a small
one, but nevertheless a doubt of his father&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>And by the time they were once more on board
the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>, Skippy was fearful that possibly,
after all, his father might be the actual murderer
of Josiah Flint!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">FOR SKIPPY</span></h2>
<p>Skippy washed the dishes and cleaned up the
cabin, then made some fresh coffee. He put the
two cups on a little tin tray and carried it out on
deck where his father sat disconsolately puffing a
pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made this good an&rsquo; careful, Pop,&rdquo; he said,
handing Toby a cup of the steaming beverage.
&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;ll make you feel better, it&rsquo;s so hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby took the proffered cup and smiled wanly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer think your Pop&rsquo;s a coward, takin&rsquo; on this
way?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Skippy flushed and, to cover his embarrassment,
sat down on a stool a little distance away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah, I don&rsquo;t think that, Pop,&rdquo; he said at length.
&ldquo;I guess I know how kinda crazy an&rsquo; different you&rsquo;d
act after seem&rsquo; that. Gee, it musta been pretty
awful to make you act so different.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know how yer mean by different, Sonny, but I
ain&rsquo;t blamin&rsquo; yer. I know it must look funny, but it
ain&rsquo;t. Besides I ain&rsquo;t a coward &rsquo;bout it. If I&rsquo;d
told the mate right on the spot, he&rsquo;d had ter keep
me till the police come. Then what would happened
ter <i>you</i>? Even if I give myself up now
they&rsquo;ll hold me on charges an&rsquo; the law&rsquo;s that slow,
it&rsquo;ll be months mebbe &rsquo;fore I kin clear myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;d be better&rsquo;n lettin&rsquo; &rsquo;em think you was
the one that killed Mr. Flint, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought mebbe we could run somewheres out
west or the like, hey Skippy? Yer don&rsquo;t know what
the law is once yer git in its fist. If they can&rsquo;t find
nobody else they&rsquo;ll pin it on me no matter what we
say&mdash;I know it! So we might&rsquo;s well take our duds
an&rsquo; beat it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop, you&rsquo;re not talkin&rsquo; like yourself. You got
sorta crazy on accounta thinkin&rsquo; how all this&rsquo;ll hurt
me. Gee whiz, forget about me, because you can&rsquo;t
have the cops thinkin&rsquo; you did it, when you didn&rsquo;t!
Gee, I&rsquo;ll get along somehow, honest I will, Pop.
I&rsquo;ll get along better to know you did what was right
an&rsquo; told the truth. An&rsquo; even the law I bet can see
when a man&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; the truth an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll let you out
quick&mdash;so will you go for my sake, Pop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby brought a hairy fist down on his bony knees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fer yer sake that I didn&rsquo;t want ter go near
&rsquo;em, Skippy,&rdquo; he said vehemently. &ldquo;But if yer
promise yer Pop ter stay good an&rsquo; all till they let me
out, I don&rsquo;t care. Fer my sake I <i>wanta</i> go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, Pop, I&rsquo;m glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby drank his coffee with a determined gulp,
then got up and stalked into the cabin with the
empty cup. When he came out, he held out his
hands to Skippy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, then, Sonny,&rdquo; he said gripping the boy
by the shoulders, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be a-gittin&rsquo; back ter the
<i>Apollyon</i> &rsquo;fore too much water slips inter the bay,
hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was thinkin&rsquo; of, Pop,&rdquo; Skippy answered
and averted his head so that his father
should not see the tears swimming in his eyes.
&ldquo;And, Pop, you&rsquo;re kinda calm now, ain&rsquo;t you? Calm
enough to remember better&rsquo;n when we were comin&rsquo;
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby Dare nodded wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What yer wanta know, Skippy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that you&rsquo;re good an&rsquo; sure that you didn&rsquo;t
hear him make a noise from the time you first seen
him till you ran outa the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m sure, Sonny. And like I told you, the
grin was the same too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then he <i>was</i> dead, Pop&mdash;dead all the time, an&rsquo;
somebody with an automatic did it because the second
mate said he dreamed he heard somebody runnin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; then he heard a muffled kicker shoving off
aft like I saw when we come along. Whoever had
that automatic was in that kicker, Pop. I got a
hunch about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the coppers believe you, Sonny. But
c&rsquo;mon, we&rsquo;ll take the chance. Anyways, I&rsquo;ll tell
what I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked forward together and were just
about to descend when they saw a long, dark
painted launch shoot alongside of the <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i>. As Skippy and his father leaned over to
get a better view they were blinded with the glaring
rays of a searchlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Coppers, Pop!</i>&rdquo; Skippy hissed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the coppers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/im2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="772" />
<p class="pcap">&ldquo;COPPERS, POP!&rdquo; SKIPPY HISSED. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S THE COPPERS!&rdquo; <i>Frontispiece</i></p>
</div>
<p>Toby gripped his son&rsquo;s trembling fingers in his
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, Dare!&rdquo; a deep voice commanded
from the police launch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Toby answered hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right up. Stay right where you are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pop an&rsquo; I were just comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Skippy cried to
them, &ldquo;that is, we were just goin&rsquo; back to the yacht&mdash;the
<i>A&mdash;Apollyon</i> an&rsquo; tell them how it all really
happened. Pop ran away on accounta me, but after
we talked about it he decided to go back an&rsquo; tell....
Mr. Flint was dead before Pop got there&mdash;<i>he
was; honest!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; laughed the first officer to reach the
deck. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s interestin&rsquo;. But I&rsquo;d wait till
the rest of the gang gets up, kid, because they all
got ears too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy watched them troop up until the last man
set foot on the barge&rsquo;s worn deck. Six men, he
thought, with not a little fear. How weak would
his father&rsquo;s story seem to these frowning cops?
Would they believe him as he had believed him?</p>
<p>His fingers were entwined in his father&rsquo;s in a tight
grip and yet he had the feeling that Toby was already
snatched away from him. Now that the police
confronted them he was terribly afraid and in
that instant his hopes fled as quickly as the stars in
the face of gathering storm clouds overhead.</p>
<p>Then Toby spoke in his hoarse, broken
voice....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">ALONE</span></h2>
<p>Skippy&rsquo;s hopes were somewhat rekindled during
Toby&rsquo;s recital of his visit to the yacht. The story
sounded so straightforward as he told it, that it did
not seem possible that these representatives of the
law could find a single flaw in it. And yet to his
utter dismay they found more than a flaw in it; they
found it sufficiently damning to threaten his unhappy
father with certain conviction.</p>
<p>They had already seen Inspector Jones and had
had his word for it that Toby Dare had threatened
to &ldquo;fix Josiah Flint,&rdquo; and there was also the corroboration
of the inspector&rsquo;s men. There was also
the strongly incriminating statement of the second
mate of the <i>Apollyon</i> and the charge that Toby refused
to stop when called to from the yacht by Skinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Pop never carried a gun!&rdquo; Skippy cried in
protest. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say that he did!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a robbery charge too,&rdquo; said one of the
officers sternly. &ldquo;You went to Flint&rsquo;s yacht because
you were sore and Inspector Jones heard you crack
that it would be bad for Flint if he didn&rsquo;t kick in for
the loss of the barge. It adds up swell for a jury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;and when Flint give you
the razz like you&rsquo;re trying to tell us, you burn up,
shoot him, then you choke him and frisk him to get
that three hundred with plenty interest back. Your
fingerprints on his throat are the only fingerprints
we found. What did you do with the gun&mdash;throw
it in the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby denied it all with a groan, and Skippy sidled
up to his father and held on to his arm with a gesture
of protection. The officers frowned for there
is neither time nor place for sentiment in the progress
of the law. They had come to arrest Toby
Dare for the murder and robbery of Josiah Flint
and all Skippy&rsquo;s pleading would not thwart them.</p>
<p>The faint boom of thunder sounded as Toby was
led into the police launch and a flash of lightning
streaked the black sky just above the <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i>. But Skippy was indifferent to everything
save the hopeless, staring look that his father gave
him as their eyes met.</p>
<p>He fought back the tears bravely and smiled his
bravest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Pop, stop thinking about me again, huh!&rdquo;
he cried desperately. &ldquo;Gee whiz, I&rsquo;ll be swell&mdash;I
promise I will so will you cheer up an&rsquo; everythin&rsquo;,
huh? Because you gotta prove you&rsquo;re tellin&rsquo; the
truth an&rsquo; never had a gun so how could you do what
they say you did? So will you cheer up if I tell you
I&rsquo;ll be all right, no matter what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toby Dare&rsquo;s troubled face lighted with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skippy, boy,&rdquo; he gulped, &ldquo;I kin do anythin&rsquo; when
I hear yer talk like that. Jest hearin&rsquo; yer say yer&rsquo;ll
be a good boy&rsquo;s enough fer me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, Pop,&rdquo; Skippy said, forcing a
laugh. &ldquo;So we won&rsquo;t even say so long &rsquo;cause they&rsquo;ll
let you come back in a day or so, I bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Toby assured him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re bound ter
let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was all, for the launch chugged off leaving
Skippy strangely numb and bewildered. He
watched the snakelike movements of the trim craft
as she darted through the inlet but soon the darkness
enfolded her from view. After a few moments
they switched on their running lights but there was
too much distance between them for the boy to see
his father and so he turned his back to the inlet and
slowly walked toward the little cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Not a light had appeared the length or breadth
of the whole barge colony since the police launch
slipped up to the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> yet Skippy knew
that every man and woman in Brown&rsquo;s Basin was
awake and watching all that had transpired. His
father had told him that these strange, lawless people
had a surprising faculty for learning of the law&rsquo;s
arrival in the inlet. And hating the law as they
did, they kept silently out of its sight, nor did they
want to be drawn into it through another&rsquo;s troubles.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this knowledge, Skippy had the
feeling that he had only to call out and ask for help
for himself and his father, and his lawless neighbors
would immediately respond. Yet that is just
what Toby had warned him against. Moreover,
his promise to avoid dubious company was not ten
minutes old.</p>
<p>And so he resolved to bear his troubles manfully
and alone, though never in his life had he so wanted
the warmth and sympathy of human companionship.
He was young enough to be afraid, yet old enough
to feel ashamed of it. But the events of the day
and his father&rsquo;s unhappy plight finally proved too
much for him and with trembling under lip he
sought the shelter of the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>A few minutes later a terrific storm broke over
the river and swept through the Basin relentlessly.
Rain lashed against the tiny windows of the cabin on
the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> and the wind moaned eerily
in and out of the inlet.</p>
<p>Skippy buried his tousled head under a pillow in
his bunk and tried to stifle the sobs that would not
stop. His heart raced madly in his breast every
time he thought of his father and his fears increased
with every crash of thunder. Could it possibly be
that his father wouldn&rsquo;t come back?</p>
<p>He squirmed farther under the bedclothes. He
would have shut out his thoughts if that had been
possible. Presently he heard a muffled knocking
at the cabin door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">A VISITOR</span></h2>
<p>Skippy sat up instantly, threw off the bedclothes
and slid to the floor. Then he hurried to the little
table and lighted the lamp, meanwhile glancing
toward the door uneasily. The knock sounded
again; this time insistently.</p>
<p>He rushed to the door and swung it open. A
man stood before him in the pelting rain, the tallest,
broadest man he had ever seen in his life. He
could not have been out of his twenties and had a
large, rather amiable looking face; so large, indeed,
that it made his blue eyes seem small and insignificant.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/im3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="792" />
<p class="pcap">A MAN STOOD BEFORE HIM IN THE PELTING RAIN.</p>
</div>
<p>As Skippy waited questioningly, he moved his
ponderous neck above his upturned coat collar and
smiled, a slow, secretive smile. Then he half
turned and glanced quickly toward the inlet, before
he spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and be ye Toby&rsquo;s kid?&rdquo; he asked with a
slight brogue. &ldquo;Can I come in? And where&rsquo;s
Toby bein&rsquo; at this hour?&rdquo; He walked into the
cabin quickly.</p>
<p>The ghost of a smile flitted across Skippy&rsquo;s tear-stained
cheeks as he closed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure, come in!&rdquo; he said hospitably. &ldquo;Pop
ain&rsquo;t here. He&rsquo;s....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all right, so &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; the stranger interposed
pleasantly, and calmly divested himself of his wet
clothing. &ldquo;I got nothin&rsquo; but time. Your ould man
told me I&rsquo;d always be welcome in his diggins so here
I be. &rsquo;Tis too bad &rsquo;bout this scow, though. I only
got wise tonight that the inspectors told Toby the
<i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> was junk. Bad cess to &rsquo;em.
So Flint gypped Toby on it, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; how!&rdquo; Skippy answered dismally. &ldquo;Gee,
gee....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man got up and waving his hands deprecatingly,
made a quick movement toward one of the
windows on the inlet side. He bent his huge frame
in a stooping posture and after rubbing the steam
from the diminutive pane, he peered out intently.</p>
<p>Suddenly he turned back and smiled his slow,
secretive smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t exactly aisy in me mind, kid,&rdquo; he explained
with a low chuckle. &ldquo;I be keepin&rsquo; a
weather eye on thim coppers. They&rsquo;re curious like
&rsquo;bout some stuff and I ain&rsquo;t in the spirit to answer
thim. They got me barge and that&rsquo;s enough, so
&rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t Big Joe Tully?&rdquo; Skippy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be callin&rsquo; the turn, kid. S&rsquo;pose your Pop
give ye an earful &rsquo;bout me. Well, I started out
shootin&rsquo; straight like he did, but whilst Flint&rsquo;s got
the monop&rsquo;ly on shippin&rsquo; and the like on this river,
a guy&rsquo;s a million to one, so he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Flint won&rsquo;t have it no more,&rdquo; Skippy
gulped. &ldquo;I guess you ain&rsquo;t heard....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; asked Big Joe Tully reaching in his
pocket for a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead&mdash;he was killed tonight.&rdquo; Tears
rushed to Skippy&rsquo;s eyes again. &ldquo;An&rsquo; my Pop&rsquo;s been
sorta accused, Mr. Tully,&rdquo; he added, and blurted
out the whole story.</p>
<p>Tully was puffing energetically on his cigarette
when Skippy finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t ye be worryin&rsquo; kid,&rdquo; he said sympathetically.
&ldquo;If that ol&rsquo; rat was dead when Toby
got there they can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; to him. Toby&rsquo;ll be
home tomorrow, so he will, I bet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Skippy felt instantly cheered. He was beginning
to feel glad of Big Joe&rsquo;s comforting presence when
he bethought himself of the man&rsquo;s dubious activities
on the river. Wasn&rsquo;t it this man and his ilk that
his father had warned him against? Men who
weren&rsquo;t honest? The boy sat down on his bunk to
think it over.</p>
<p>To his surprise, Tully had got up and was putting
on his coat and hat. Immediately, Skippy forgot
that he was considering the moral aspect of an invitation
to the man to stay; he forgot all his father&rsquo;s
warnings against association with the river gentry,
and thought only of the void that Tully&rsquo;s sudden
departure would make in the long night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said you were gonna stay, Mr.
Tully?&rdquo; he said with evident disappointment.
&ldquo;Gee, now you ain&rsquo;t, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis sorry I be, kid,&rdquo; said Big Joe with a
friendly wink. &ldquo;I did think along thim lines when
I come in, but since the coppers been nosin&rsquo; &rsquo;round
here tonight, I&rsquo;ll be mosyin&rsquo; along. They might
come back and spot me here so I&rsquo;d better be takin&rsquo;
the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they catch you carryin&rsquo; <i>stuff</i>?&rdquo; Skippy asked,
interested. &ldquo;Is that why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and they did that. Somewan tipped off the
police&mdash;somewan what was jealous I wasn&rsquo;t carryin&rsquo;
<i>their</i> stuff.&rdquo; He laughed lightly. &ldquo;The coppers
hook ye either way, so they do. Look how
quick they come after Toby and they knew he was
on the up and up! So I says, does it pay?&rdquo; Then,
seeing the shadow on Skippy&rsquo;s face, he added:
&ldquo;But sure you&rsquo;ll be seein&rsquo; Toby back tomorrow, kid.
They can&rsquo;t be keepin&rsquo; him when he didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do it, so they can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Skippy echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a cinch, so &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; said Big Joe Tully with an
awkward attempt to sympathize. &ldquo;Be hittin&rsquo; the
hay now, kid, an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll be seein&rsquo; Toby tomorrow or
me name ain&rsquo;t Joe Tully. Now I&rsquo;ll be swingin&rsquo; into
me kicker and chug her up the river till daylight.
I&rsquo;ll be layin&rsquo; low a while and some day I&rsquo;ll be seein&rsquo;
ye and Toby. Be watchin&rsquo; the old step. S&rsquo;long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went out like a breeze and Skippy soon heard
the chug of his engine. Another craft muffled so
that the ears of the law would not hear its approach!
The boy made a mental grimace at the
thought of all this muffled life on the river, Big Joe
Tully included. His inherent love of clean living
and honesty had come to the fore as his father had
wanted it to. And honesty and clean living <i>did</i> pay
despite what Tully had said. Certainly it would
pay his father tomorrow! He lay back on his bunk
and closed his burning eyes.</p>
<p>Tomorrow was almost here ... almost....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">A SUGGESTION</span></h2>
<p>Many tomorrows had come and gone before
Skippy saw his father again and then it was under
circumstances that the lonely boy had not contemplated.
The shadow of prison walls already
threatened Toby Dare for the rest of his natural
life; conviction was certain.</p>
<p>Skippy returned to the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> toward
noon. It threatened to be a sultry day; the air was
heavy and still, and a sickening blue haze hung over
the inlet. Brown&rsquo;s Basin, always more or less
apathetic under the glare of noonday, was unusually
silent and Skippy listened in vain for the cheering
sound of a human voice.</p>
<p>He set about preparing lunch, but it was a half-hearted,
pathetic attempt, for the Dare larder was
getting dangerously bare. He had been living on
an almost exclusive diet of pancakes for more than
a week past and Nature was beginning to retaliate
for Skippy was far from being a robust boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>He pushed back his plate after a time, hurried
out of the cabin and got into his motor boat. It
was his only consolation during the interminable
days and nights of his father&rsquo;s continued absence
and on this particular day his heart warmed toward
it with a new, affectionate thought.</p>
<p>His fishing tackle was assembled at his feet and
he set the nose of the little boat downstream as
soon as he reached the river. Fog horns pierced
the still, hazy air with their dismal warnings and the
screams of steam winches and tooting whistles
echoed and reechoed about the boy&rsquo;s tousled head.</p>
<p>He watched the passing river traffic abstractedly,
particularly the lumbering and heavily-laden barges
moving along in the wake of chortling tugs. The
sight of them always made him think of his father
and of what might have been, and the more he saw
of them the more did the feeling grow within him
that it was a strange and unjust law that could take
his father away from him. Moreover, he could
not understand why a jury would not believe his
father&rsquo;s straightforward story, which proved so
clearly to him that another hand had taken Josiah
Flint&rsquo;s life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Hadn&rsquo;t the police found that the rich man had
been robbed of a considerable sum of money and
hadn&rsquo;t they admitted that it was neither on Toby&rsquo;s
person nor on the barge? Skippy remembered only
too well the day when the police ransacked the <i>Minnie
M. Baxter</i> fore and aft for Josiah Flint&rsquo;s money.
But their search was futile, as he knew it would be,
and although they now had ample proof that
poverty threatened him, they still insisted that the
stolen money had been hidden by his unhappy
father.</p>
<p>But Skippy did not consider the testimony of
Marty Skinner that he, on returning to his employer&rsquo;s
stateroom, saw Toby Dare with his arm out
the porthole (from which a clever and venomous
prosecuting attorney drew the inference for the jury
that Toby was disposing of the pistol from which
the fatal shot was fired). Skinner did not swear he
saw any weapon, but his testimony, linked with the
other evidence, made for a strong circumstantial
case.</p>
<p>Skinner also testified that he had rushed to his
employer&rsquo;s side as Toby raced from the room; that
upon discovering that Josiah Flint had been shot he
chased after the squatter and shouted to him, as he
made off in his kicker, to no avail. The second
mate corroborated the testimony that Toby failed
to heed the cries for him to halt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>While the pistol had not been found, Inspector
Jones and his men testified that Toby had threatened
to fix Josiah Flint because he felt he had been
cheated of his life savings of $300 in buying a rotten
barge from Flint. That, the prosecutor insisted to
the jury, furnished the motive for the crime. Altogether
he made a case which convinced the twelve
men, but it did not convince Skippy for he could not
be convinced that his father was guilty.</p>
<p>Skippy was deep in his bitter reflections and did
not see the familiar launch of the harbor inspectors
until it was almost upon him. Inspector Jones&rsquo;
bright and smiling face came alongside of him with
startling suddenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Skippy!&rdquo; he said pleasantly. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy winced and a frown darkened his face.
He could not forget that Inspector Jones&rsquo; testimony
had helped to take his father from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sick on accounta my Pop, that&rsquo;s what,&rdquo;
said he bitterly. &ldquo;You helped make things worse
for him too, Mr. Jones, on account of the things
you told about what he said that day after you inspected
the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Jones&rsquo; bland countenance looked immediately
troubled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told the truth, Skippy,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;I
told only what your father had said and my men
were there to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have said that Pop said he was
gonna <i>fix</i> Mr. Flint &rsquo;cause you mighta known he
really didn&rsquo;t mean it. Pop was mad then, but he
promised me before we left for the <i>Apollyon</i> that
night that he wouldn&rsquo;t lose his head. Gee, he&rsquo;s
even sworn since he didn&rsquo;t take Mr. Flint&rsquo;s life an&rsquo;
don&rsquo;t you suppose I know when my Pop&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; the
truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Inspector Jones answered with real
feeling in his voice; &ldquo;I guess you know your Pop
better than anybody, Skippy. I&rsquo;m sorry, the law required
me to testify against him. But it was my
duty&mdash;can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe they&rsquo;ll be keepin&rsquo; my Pop in
jail when he&rsquo;s innocent, too, huh?&rdquo; Skippy asked
excitedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather inclined to believe that your father
didn&rsquo;t shoot Flint,&rdquo; answered the inspector. &ldquo;But
I can&rsquo;t do anything about it, Skippy, and I doubt if
my testimony alone would convict him. It&rsquo;s that
District-Attorney and Marty Skinner that&rsquo;s made
it so tough for your father. You know Skinner
swore he saw Toby at the porthole and the D. A.
put it over to the jury that he was dropping the
gun which did the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but that diver didn&rsquo;t find no gun,&rdquo; Skippy
replied, &ldquo;an&rsquo; my Pop swore he wasn&rsquo;t near no porthole
an&rsquo; besides nobody tried findin&rsquo; out about that
kicker that was around when we come up. I&rsquo;ll
betcha the feller what did the killin&rsquo; got away in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about not finding the gun, Skippy,&rdquo;
Inspector Jones nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look
into the kicker angle some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, thanks, Mr. Jones, me&rsquo;n Pop we&rsquo;d be so
thankful, we would. Maybe if I went to see Mr.
Skinner he&rsquo;d help us &rsquo;cause I guess hard as he is he&rsquo;ll
see I don&rsquo;t tell lies even to get my Pop free. Maybe
I oughta go right away to see him, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Jones nodded thinking how futile the
boy&rsquo;s errand would be. But he had boys of his own
and he did not want to jolt the lad out of his pleasant
dream. So all he said was: &ldquo;The sooner the
better, because I hear he&rsquo;s going on the <i>Apollyon</i>
for a week&rsquo;s cruise. You know Buck Flint has gone
to Europe and now Skinner, who was only Josiah
Flint&rsquo;s yes-man for years, is ruling the roost and living
high on a millionaire&rsquo;s yacht. Buck says he
won&rsquo;t ever board her so it&rsquo;s pretty soft for Skinner.
He&rsquo;s got the boat anchored just outside in the bay,
ready to nose her out to sea after nightfall. If
you get right on down there, you&rsquo;ll catch him
aboard, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Skippy smiled his thanks and turned his little
motor over. The inspector waved his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the sound of that kicker,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;I
take it you&rsquo;ve lost Toby&rsquo;s muffler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Skippy answered laughing, &ldquo;what do I
need with a muffler, huh? &rsquo;Cepting it might be better
for fishin&rsquo; with. But gee, I should worry about
livin&rsquo; on fish if I can see Mr. Skinner, huh? Pop
ought to be out by&mdash;by....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, eh?&rdquo; Inspector Jones interposed
turning his head aside and blowing his nose hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Skippy answered wistfully, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say
tomorrow &rsquo;cause then&mdash;oh well, it&rsquo;s too quick. But
anyway, if I see Mr. Skinner it won&rsquo;t be long after
tomorrow, I bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had yet to learn from his bitter experience
that tomorrow never comes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">ALL OF A KIND</span></h2>
<p>Skippy&rsquo;s little boat chugged out of the bay and
around toward the Hook. It was late afternoon
and the haze had deepened into an ominous sultriness.
White caps danced atop the waves and off on
the horizon black clouds and black sea met in dismal
union. A flock of gulls swarmed about, flapping
their huge wings between sky and sea with
monotonous precision.</p>
<p>A miscellaneous collection of craft was anchored
just outside the bay; sailboats, fishing smacks, dories
and yachts of every size, and not the least of these
was the shining hull of the lovely <i>Apollyon</i>. Skippy
caught sight of her immediately and slowed his own
little boat that he might have a better view of her
in the light of day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Her superstructure was painted a most delicate
shade of green and Skippy understood then why he
had imagined her to be of that ghostly whiteness below
her anchor lights which shone like stars against
that dark, memorable night. Too, the large gilt
letters spelling out her queer name seemed not so
ornate now as when he had first seen them.</p>
<p>His first reaction to the lovely yacht had been one
of envy and admiration; it was so now and he tried
hard not to think of the unhappy sequel that his first
visit to the <i>Apollyon</i> had brought. Yet somehow
he could not shake off the fear-inspiring memory of
what the name really meant and he wondered if anything
but evil could tread those spotless decks.</p>
<p>He chuckled a little and turned his motor boat
toward the yacht. There were signs of a near-departure
aboard and he caught sight of the second
mate resplendent in his spotless uniform and cap.
Leaning over the forward rail, he recognized
Skippy at once, and waved his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t the kid!&rdquo; he called cheerfully.
&ldquo;Young Dare, hey? Well, you&rsquo;ve come a ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Skippy smiled. &ldquo;I come down to see
Mr. Skinner. It&rsquo;s awful particular what I gotta
see him about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look&rsquo;s if it might be a case of life or death
at that,&rdquo; the second mate mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a case of life, Mister&mdash;my Pop&rsquo;s whole
life,&rdquo; said Skippy anxiously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wanta
see Mr. Skinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The second mate was all contrition. &ldquo;Kid, I
clean forgot about your Pop, &rsquo;deed I did. C&rsquo;mon
aboard. Sure Mr. Skinner&rsquo;ll be seein&rsquo; you.
&rsquo;Course I ain&rsquo;t promisin&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll find him easy talkin&rsquo;
to &rsquo;cause he ain&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s right set in his notions
&rsquo;bout you Basin and river folks; he thinks you&rsquo;re all
rascals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his boss, ol&rsquo; Flint&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Skippy began protesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knowed like you&rsquo;n me and plenty others that
the old boss was a tough egg&mdash;and between you&rsquo;n
me Skinner ain&rsquo;t no angel hisself&mdash;but that don&rsquo;t
change his mind none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy realized this full well a little later when
Marty Skinner refused to hear him, ordered him off
the boat, and shouted that his father was a rogue
and so was he.</p>
<p>Skippy rushed blindly out of the cabin. The
door slammed behind him, the same door that had
slammed behind his father on that tragic night. He
had accomplished just nothing at all in that cabin
of past horrors, nothing except to hear from a gentleman&rsquo;s
lips what his kind really thought of river
people.</p>
<p>And he, Skippy Dare, was one of the river people&mdash;himself,
the son of a rogue!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">DRIFTING</span></h2>
<p>Skippy nosed the motor boat toward the Hook.
He had no thought of anything save that he was
angry and hurt and wanted to feel the fresh, salt
breeze blow over his burning face. He felt that
he must think over this new and humiliating status
in which Marty Skinner had so cruelly placed him,
and he wanted to think of it where no one could see
the unhappiness that it caused him.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t the heart to turn back toward the
Basin and home. Home! He frowned at the
word, for it seemed that the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> and
all that it represented could bring him nothing now
but recurring thoughts of the hated Skinner. All
that the man had said had left its mark on the sensitive
boy&rsquo;s mind and for the first time in his life
he felt a bitter hatred toward a fellow being.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>That Marty Skinner, old Josiah Flint&rsquo;s right-hand
man, should call his father a rogue, was hardly
to be endured. But if it were so, he reasoned in a
calmer moment, then all the more reason for the
blame to fall on the dead Josiah. Hadn&rsquo;t Old
Flint himself been the worst rogue of all?</p>
<p>He was tempted to return and shout these
thoughts so that all aboard the <i>Apollyon</i> might
hear. He wanted to tell them what Toby had said
about Josiah Flint making the despised Brown&rsquo;s
Basin possible because of his selfish, unscrupulous
dealings.</p>
<p>But, boy-like, Skippy&rsquo;s anger was soon reduced
to a smoldering memory and his father&rsquo;s imminent
incarceration was a thing that had to be faced. Just
now he was forced to think of his own present situation,
for a significant sputtering from the motor
gave warning that he was about to have trouble.</p>
<p>He had not his father&rsquo;s knack for adjusting the
rebellious motor, and so he decided to turn the boat
about and make for the quieter waters of the bay.
But just then the motor stalled and despite his earnest
efforts, it refused to respond.</p>
<p>Skippy looked about him anxiously and saw that
he had already been carried an alarming distance.
Dusk was rapidly settling, hastened by the deepening
haze and in a few moments the tide and undertow
had swept him out of sight of all the anchored
craft clustered about the <i>Apollyon</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>He looked hopefully toward the Hook but saw
that it was useless to try and reach it even with the
one oar that the little boat had in reserve. The
tide was against him.</p>
<p>After a quick glance about, he hunted around
among some neglected tools lying at his feet and
picked out the searchlight. But that, too, refused
to respond; the battery was dead. Then he looked
for some matches only to meet with disheartening
disappointment.</p>
<p>He got to his knees after that and worked furiously
at the cold motor, squinting at his hopeless
task in the near-darkness. The boom of thunder
could be heard from out at sea, and with the swiftly
passing minutes the storm came nearer and nearer
until it broke directly overhead.</p>
<p>Lightning flashed across the drifting boat and
Skippy dodged under the bow. There was something
terrifying about the elements when one was
alone and drifting steadily toward the sea in an
open boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>After a momentary lull, he crept out, not a little
ashamed of his cowardice. He looked about, trying
hard not to look or feel panicky despite the fact
that he could see nothing of the Hook or anything
else. Darkness and high, shadowy waves upon
which the little boat bobbed were all that met his
frightened gaze. Then a damp, cold wind began
to blow.</p>
<p>He crouched down in the bottom of the boat with
a feeling of dull despair. Rain pattered into an old
rusty bait can that lay at his feet and he edged his
shivering body closer under the bow. Curiously
enough, he was quite calm now and the thought that
his situation was dangerous did not enter his mind.</p>
<p>Skippy-like, he was thinking only that he was
terribly hungry and more than anything else he
wanted to eat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">LIGHTS</span></h2>
<p>The thunder and lightning died away after a
time but the rain continued. The constant boom of
the sea gradually wore away some of Skippy&rsquo;s calm
and he raised his head from time to time to gaze
apprehensively at the dark sea rising all about him
in mountainous waves.</p>
<p>The sky seemed a black void and at times as the
little boat tossed about in the waves, he had the
breath-taking sensation that he had turned turtle.
Once, he mused about what probability there was
of his being carried clear across the sea to some European
port. He had heard of men being able to
live without food or water from ten to fourteen
days. Well, he had his fishing outfit, he reasoned
hopefully; he needn&rsquo;t starve, but how to get water
puzzled him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>After a few more minutes of tossing wildly about,
he decided that the little boat could probably never
stand an ocean voyage. With each succeeding
wave it came perilously near to upsetting and he
doubted that the craft could triumph over the angry
sea much longer.</p>
<p>That contingency awoke a strong determination
in him, for he got to his feet, reached for the oar
and struggled valiantly to balance the boat against
the oncoming foe. The rain soaked him through
to the skin but he was not cold for he was kept in
constant action trying to make one oar do the work
of two.</p>
<p>He had lost all sense of time and direction; he
thought only of keeping the boat balanced. That
he could not keep it up very long did not occur to
him, for he already felt the effects of the past week&rsquo;s
malnutrition and his long journey from the Basin
had fatigued him.</p>
<p>After what seemed an interminable time he
caught a glimpse of a light, a faint gleam, but nevertheless
a light. He gasped with joy and looked
hard into the darkness to get a definite idea of its
location. In point of fact he looked so hard he all
but swamped the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Great beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead
when he righted the boat, but he came up triumphant
on the crest of a wave. The exertion
was too much for him, however; he felt inexpressibly
weak and tired. His muscles ached and a giddiness
in his head made him feel as if he must lie
down.</p>
<p>But there was the light just ahead and he bent
his frail body in a supreme effort to reach it. He
was cheered because it did not seem to move and
he ventured to hope that it might be on the shore.
The main thing&mdash;it was a light, and light might
reasonably be expected to mean rescue by all the
rules of the game.</p>
<p>Suddenly a great arc of faint yellow light swept
from behind and circled his head. He had come
to no decision about its origin before it came again,
a little brighter than before. Then after some minutes
had passed and it had grown still brighter, it
occurred to him that it was from the lighthouse at
the Hook and the great light had gradually penetrated
the fast dissolving haze.</p>
<p>He took heart at this because he knew he could
not be so very far away from land. But he knew it
was futile to even hope to get back there in his boat.
It might be ten miles and it might be twenty. The
great light at the Hook boasted a range of thirty
miles on a clear night, he had heard his father say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>The light that gave him real hope was the heartening
glimmer just ahead. He knew that it was
not just because he wished it so fervently, but he
could plainly see that it became brighter as the boat
advanced.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he heard the faint ringing of a
bell, which echoed eerily on the shifting wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">THE BELL BUOY</span></h2>
<p>He listened intently and thought that it came
from the direction of the light. It rang again and
again, each time a little louder. Suddenly, however,
he was aware that the light seemed no longer
stationary. He had the disheartening experience
of realizing that his beacon of hope was a running
light on a fishing smack. He felt like crying as he
watched the shadowy hull gaining speed for he realized
that she must have just started ahead, having
waited for the wind to change.</p>
<p>Every wave carried her farther and farther away
from the watching boy. If he had only got there
just a little sooner, he thought dismally. But he
had done the best he could. There was nothing
left now but to sit and watch her swallowed up by
the darkness and the mountainous seas and that had
happened in a few minutes&rsquo; time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>He was glad he had not been foolish enough to
hope that he could reach her and overtake her, only
to be disappointed and use up what little strength he
had left. That at least was some satisfaction and
it helped him bear his desperate plight a little more
patiently.</p>
<p>The constant booming of the sea had a queer effect
on his sensitive ears. He imagined himself to
be hearing all sorts of noises, particularly the ringing
of the bell. At times he could have sworn he
heard it right at hand and at other times it seemed
but a mocking echo.</p>
<p>The air was quite clear now, though the rain continued,
and Skippy saw to his dismay that the boat
was getting a little too full of water for his safety.
He put down the oar for a while and bailed her out
with his rusty bait can.</p>
<p>The little boat tossed against each rising wave
like a feather; but he worked feverishly and trusted
to luck that it would not upset. Then after a few
minutes he was startled by the sound of the bell
ringing right over his head. Before he had time to
look up he felt the boat bump hard against something.</p>
<p>He was on his feet in a second and saw to his
great surprise that the boat was alongside of a bell
buoy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>It has been truly said that time and tide wait for
no man and certainly Skippy was aware of this instantly,
for in the next second a giant wave had
washed him out of reach of the buoy. This realization
made him desperate and he got into action to
get back to it, for he well knew now that to drift on
through the night would mean certain death.</p>
<p>With a swift movement he pushed his wet hair
back from his high forehead. Then he bent over,
got the oar and grabbed a rope, holding it tightly
in his hand. And for fully five minutes he battled
and struggled against the undertow.</p>
<p>His eyes were wide and staring from the strain
and little streams of water ran down either cheek.
His clothes from head to foot were weighted against
him with water but he never stopped until he had
brought the boat back against the buoy and in a
second he had thrown the painter around it and
pulled it taut.</p>
<p>That done he sank down in the bottom of the
boat, exhausted.</p>
<p>For some time his mind was an utter blank. He
was too tired and weak to think or even to care.
But the rain beating steadily down on his unprotected
body soon chilled him back into action and he
got up and exercised his arms and legs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>As the buoy swayed upon each succeeding swell,
the bell tolled mournfully. Its eerie echoes were
faint and quickly lost in the noise of the pounding
sea, and Skippy decided that no mariner ten minutes&rsquo;
sail from the bell was likely to look that way.
Also, the quick wash of the sea prevented the bell
from tolling its loudest and longest. Nothing but
his own two hands could do that.</p>
<p>And so he did it.</p>
<p>For the next hour he bent his frail body over the
swaying buoy and swung the cold, wet bell back and
forth, back and forth. Peal after peal tolled forth
dismally and though his eyes became blurred with
weariness he knew that he had missed nothing, for
nothing had passed for him to miss.</p>
<p>So it went on through the long, dark hours. He
would take an interval of rest and then jump up to
his vigil at the bell for fear he would fall asleep and
miss some passing ship.</p>
<p>The night seemed interminable. Indeed, he began
to believe that he had fallen asleep and that a
day had passed and another night had come without
his being aware of it, for never had he thought the
dark hours were so long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Morning came at last and with the first streak of
light on the eastern horizon, hope came back anew.
The rain gradually ceased and during Skippy&rsquo;s intervals
of rest he watched, with not a little awe, the
wonder of dawn at sea. Little by little the night
fled before the roseate morn and soon the entire sky
was flooded with soft light. And as the sun crept
up out of the sea he stretched himself across the wet
seats and relaxed.</p>
<p>Two hours later, he woke with the sun shining
full in his face. He sat up, startled, and realized
that his head was aching and that he felt stiff and
chilled. Moreover, he felt sick with despair to
think that he had slept away the hours of daylight,
hours when a ship might have passed near enough
for him to signal.</p>
<p>He stood up and scanned the sunlit water in all
directions but there was not a sign of a sail, not a
sign of a ship. In the distance, a gull soared high
above the water and after a moment another one
seemed to leap out of space and join it.</p>
<p>The tide was going out and the whole surface of
the blue-green water seemed to roll on toward the
horizon in a series of undulating hills. A gentle
murmur filled the warm, sunlit air and Skippy could
not believe that the booming surf of the past night
had been anything but a bad dream.</p>
<p>He rang the bell for a time but had to give it up
because of a terrible giddiness in his head. And
so for hours, he sat anxiously scanning the illimitable
sea and sky, hoping, hoping, hoping....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Noon came and passed and the sun scorched him
cruelly. The boat, too, had become a constant
source of anxiety for she developed a leak and had
to be continually bailed out, and he was thankful
that he had not obeyed a former impulse and tried
to row her east in the hope that he would strike the
Hook.</p>
<p>Toward mid-afternoon he was conscious of pains
in his chest, and his hunger and thirst were becoming
unbearable, particularly the thirst, for the heat
of the sun was intense. He wished fervently for
the cooling rain of the night before.</p>
<p>Sunset came, however, and with it a soft, cool
wind. Skippy welcomed it, but hated the gray light
of approaching twilight that obliterated the deep
blue clouds. It seemed to spell doom to him and
he cried out in despair. If daylight had not
brought rescue what hope was there left for another
long night?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>His hopes sprang up afresh, however, and he conceived
the idea of tying to the bell a long length of
rope which he found in the bottom of the boat. In
this manner, he could ring it constantly just by pulling
the rope which required little exertion on his
part. By dusk he was feeling too sick to either
stand or sit up.</p>
<p>He entered his second night at sea both hopeful
and despairing. Every doleful clang from the bell
brought him hope but in the following silence it
would quickly vanish and he would sink in depths
of despair. Then with his fast-ebbing strength he
would pull hopefully at the rope again.</p>
<div class="img">

<p class="pcap">EVERY DOLEFUL CLANG FROM THE BELL BROUGHT SKIPPY HOPE.</p>

hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">RESCUED</span></h2>
<p>A few hours before dawn a long, trim, high-powered
motor boat cut through the placidly rolling
waves. Its motor was so muffled that it emitted no
more than a low droning sound and could be heard
for only a short distance, despite the fact that it had
been let out to full speed.</p>
<p>Besides the man at the wheel the boat carried six
men, three standing fore and three aft. One of the
men aft half lounged over the coaming and his
broad shoulders and large, amiable face all but
filled the stern of the boat. The spray constantly
swept over his big, dangling hands and the salt moisture
struck at his tanned cheeks but he seemed not
to notice. His entire attention, like that of his comrades,
was centered on the grayish black horizon;
his eyes seemed to miss nothing, yet there was an
abstracted look in them that the man at the wheel
did not fail to notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whadja hear, Big Joe?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>The big man nodded his head without moving his
body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis that buoy,&rdquo; he said absently. &ldquo;Sure and
she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; a great rate for such a calm, me lad.
Even in pretty bad storms I niver knowed Flint&rsquo;s
buoy to be ringin&rsquo; like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flint&rsquo;s?&rdquo; queried another of the men, interested.</p>
<p>Big Joe Tully smiled reminiscently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not? &rsquo;Tis what most o&rsquo; Flint&rsquo;s men
called it. &rsquo;Tis a buoy at the intrance to Kennedy&rsquo;s
Channel and &rsquo;tis a bad spot, if iver there was wan.
Ye niver know how the tide&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to act. &rsquo;Tis
like a colleen what can&rsquo;t make up her mind, and she&rsquo;s
not to be trusted, so nobody goes by that way. Besides,
&rsquo;tis a long way round past the Hook. Anyways,
the ould boss took advantage o&rsquo; that place
and we used to meet some o&rsquo; his best customers
there and unload the stuff to thim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea takin&rsquo; us by there for an eyeful,
hey, Tully?&rdquo; suggested the man at the wheel.
&ldquo;Long&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve decided on playin&rsquo; ball with us, since
we squared that case &rsquo;gainst you, we might as well
take your tips. Seems like a wise mug like ol&rsquo; Flint
never made no mistakes. He got rich an&rsquo; the law
never got him so if <i>he</i> picked out a spot like this
buoy, he must &rsquo;a&rsquo; known what he was doin&rsquo;. Mebbe
it&rsquo;ll be a pretty good spot for our customers too?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>They all laughed at this, but Big Joe Tully merely
smiled and glanced down at the compass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and ould Flint made his mistakes and
plenty,&rdquo; he said in his soft, deep voice. &ldquo;He made
mistakes whin he didn&rsquo;t watch out that the coppers
didn&rsquo;t take the scows o&rsquo; men what was workin&rsquo; for
his racket. And he made a mistake whin he stuck
Toby Dare with a piece o&rsquo; junk. I guess he thought
he&rsquo;d be puttin&rsquo; me on me uppers where I&rsquo;d be goin&rsquo;
back and beg him for work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got knocked off fust, didn&rsquo;t he, Big Joe?&rdquo;
laughed the man at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he did. &rsquo;Tis too bad he couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; lived
to see how quick I connected with you guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad he couldn&rsquo; lived anyways,&rdquo; said another
of the men, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause that poor guy Dare
wouldn&rsquo;t be in the can then. Anyhow I don&rsquo;t think
he knocked him off. I think he&rsquo;d liked to &rsquo;cause
Flint give him a lousy break, but I believe what he
said in court that some other guy beat him to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know lots o&rsquo; guys what were layin&rsquo; for ould
Flint,&rdquo; said Big Joe. &ldquo;Sure he&rsquo;d been dead a dozen
times if iverywan what had it in for him, did what
they said they&rsquo;d like to. That&rsquo;s why they won&rsquo;t be
holdin&rsquo; poor Toby.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, they <i>are</i> holdin&rsquo; poor Toby,&rdquo; said
the man at the wheel. &ldquo;He was sentenced late yesterday
afternoon for twenty years to life an&rsquo; by this
time he&rsquo;s hittin&rsquo; the hay in the big house, that&rsquo;s
what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t ye hear!&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;His kid,
Skippy, ain&rsquo;t been seen since he had a talk with
Marty Skinner aboard the <i>Apollyon</i>. Poor kid, he
went there to plead for his old man, the paper says,
and that hardshell Skinner wouldn&rsquo;t give him a
break, I guess. The second mate told a reporter
that the kid left the yacht in a rush, hopped in his
kicker and beat it for the Hook. Guess he thought
as long as he couldn&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; for Toby, he&rsquo;d get
away somewhere and try an&rsquo; fergit. Well, that&rsquo;s
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Joe Tully clenched his knotted, hairy fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sufferin&rsquo; swordfish!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Poor Toby!
And that poor kid! &rsquo;Tis a howlin&rsquo; shame, so &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know &rsquo;em?&rdquo; asked the man at the wheel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;I oughta&mdash;I worked &rsquo;longside o&rsquo; Toby doin&rsquo;
Flint&rsquo;s jobs night after night, so I did. A whiter
guy than Toby niver lived. He ain&rsquo;t old&mdash;thirty-four
or so. Got married whin he was a kid and
his wife died. He&rsquo;s crazy &rsquo;bout that kid o&rsquo; his,
Skippy. &rsquo;Tis what makes me feel bad.&rdquo; Big Joe
looked down at the compass once more. &ldquo;North,
northeast,&rdquo; he said to the man at the wheel. &ldquo;We
oughta be at Flint&rsquo;s buoy in twinty minutes. There&rsquo;s
the light from the Hook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched intently the great sweeping arc of
light swinging over the smoothly rolling water.
The motor boat plunged north, then northeast and
in Big Joe Tully&rsquo;s eyes was a thoughtful, puzzled
expression, the closer they got to the buoy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye say there ain&rsquo;t somethin&rsquo; spooky &rsquo;bout the
way that bell&rsquo;s ringin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked his comrades.
&ldquo;Did ye iver hear a bell on a buoy ring like that
without stoppin&rsquo;? &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t natural, &rsquo;cause....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then he caught a glimpse of the little kicker
bobbing merrily alongside the buoy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">RIVER PEOPLE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; when I sees ye layin&rsquo; in the bottom o&rsquo; that
kicker, I&rsquo;d swore I was seein&rsquo; things so I would,&rdquo;
Big Joe Tully was saying. &ldquo;Lucky I gets it in me
noodle that somethin&rsquo;s wrong the way that bell keeps
ringin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shanty of the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> was bright
with the light of mid-morning. The floor had been
scrubbed almost to whiteness, the table was laid with
a soft Turkey red cloth and the lamp looked shiny
and clean. Skippy&rsquo;s feverish eyes took it all in before
he turned on his pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt so sick, I didn&rsquo;t exactly know it was you,&rdquo;
he said weakly. &ldquo;I heard voices, but I couldn&rsquo;t
think what it was all about. All I&rsquo;d thought all
night was that I hadda keep on ringin&rsquo; the bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, kid, and ye rang it!&rdquo; said Big Joe with a
light laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you sure saved me,&rdquo; Skippy smiled in return.
&ldquo;Gee, it was lucky you came that way, huh?
Where&rsquo;d you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Joe lighted a cigarette and puffed on it before
answering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; just puttin&rsquo; the big eye on some new location
for a new racket,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I got six
men with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it gonna be straight?&rdquo; Skippy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; Big Joe laughed. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll be straight in
the Basin and live like a human bein&rsquo;? As &rsquo;tis, what
they got? They&rsquo;re all doin&rsquo; the higher-up&rsquo;s dirty
work; but <i>me</i>, I ain&rsquo;t so foolish even if ould Flint
tipped off the coppers and they grab me scow. I
got a little money and I&rsquo;ll work this new racket and
make lots more. The doctor says ye&rsquo;ve got a pretty
weak lung so ye need a month in bed and the best o&rsquo;
food. Well, sufferin&rsquo; swordfish, we&rsquo;ll dig up the
dough so&rsquo;s ye&rsquo;ll be fat an&rsquo; sassy &rsquo;fore Toby comes
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy&rsquo;s eyes lighted up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, Mr. Tully, it must be costin&rsquo; an awful lotta
money for a lawyer to appeal the case, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Joe waved a large hand deprecatingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, Skippy. Ain&rsquo;t I doin&rsquo; it for a good
friend and ain&rsquo;t I doin&rsquo; it so&rsquo;s ye won&rsquo;t see Toby in
the can for twinty years or more? Don&rsquo;t ye be
worryin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout the dough, me lad. I made it with
the scow easy. Now it&rsquo;ll do you and Toby some
good, so &rsquo;twill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz,&rdquo; breathed the boy gratefully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too much for you to do for Pop and me &rsquo;cause we
can&rsquo;t pay it back&mdash;<i>never</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why ye gotta be forgettin&rsquo; it!&rdquo; Tully protested.
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got nobody to spend it on, kid, so I
might&rsquo;s well spend it on you and Toby. I&rsquo;d only
leave it to ye in me will whin I died!&rdquo; He laughed
loudly. &ldquo;Now&rsquo;ll we be good friends, kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy had to fight back the tears before he
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, <i>sure</i>! Gee, I like you an awful lot,
Mis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut out the <i>Mister</i>, kid! Big Joe&rsquo;s me monicker,
and nothin&rsquo; else. Now anythin&rsquo; more on that
big mind o&rsquo; yourn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy nodded hesitantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee&mdash;gee whiz,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;I just was
thinkin&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if you had enough money
so you didn&rsquo;t have to go into any crooked rackets
for a while, huh? Gee, I&rsquo;d like to think you didn&rsquo;t
have to do it, honest I would, Big Joe! Maybe I&rsquo;ll
be able to go to work when I get strong and I&rsquo;ll be
able to help then, huh? Maybe we can live on
clean, honest money like Pop wanted me to, huh?
Besides, the money you&rsquo;re helpin&rsquo; Pop and me with
is kind of from when you were runnin&rsquo; your barge
straight, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Joe got up from his chair, went over to the
table and ground out his cigarette stub in an ash
tray. Then he came back and leaning over Skippy&rsquo;s
bunk, he rumpled the boy&rsquo;s hair playfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a funny lad ye be, Skippy. But I s&rsquo;pose ye
be gettin&rsquo; it from Toby. He was always agin doin&rsquo;
Flint&rsquo;s work. Said he wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; started it if he
hadn&rsquo;t been takin&rsquo; care o&rsquo; ye so much daytimes whin
ye was sick with that throat business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop was always honest inside, that shows it,&rdquo;
said Skippy proudly.</p>
<p>Big Joe smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyways ye&rsquo;re right about me runnin&rsquo; me barge
straight the first year,&rdquo; he said vehemently. &ldquo;I
did.&rdquo; Then: &ldquo;So ye want me on the level? Well,
we&rsquo;ll be seein&rsquo; about that but we ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to starve
I&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo; ye, so I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy&rsquo;s eyes were shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get along if people can see you&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo;
to be honest, that&rsquo;s what Pop said.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sufferin&rsquo; swordfish, kid,&rdquo; said Big Joe. &ldquo;Be
quittin&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout anythin&rsquo; now &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; gettin&rsquo;
better. And no more talk about work when ye&rsquo;re
better. Sufferin&rsquo; swordfish, ye ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but skin
and bones, the doctor said! Ye&rsquo;re as pale as a
ghost, too. Eggs, milk and chicken soup is what ye
need and what ye&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;em?&rdquo; Skippy asked, chuckling weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our nixt door neighbor on the <i>Dinky O. Cross</i>,&rdquo;
Big Joe said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a right nice woman, kid&mdash;Mrs.
Duffy, and as soon as she sees us carryin&rsquo; ye in
she said it milted her heart. So we put a plank
across to her scow and she come in here and did
&rsquo;bout iverythin&rsquo; &rsquo;fore the doctor come. I give her
the dough for the things and she&rsquo;s cookin&rsquo; thim
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a&mdash;she&rsquo;s one of the river people, huh?
Like <i>you</i>, Big Joe?&rdquo; Skippy asked wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like you and me, Skippy me boy,&rdquo; answered Big
Joe, nodding his head. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; our people,
the kind what helps their own whin there&rsquo;s trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy shut his eyes to visualize the stern, cold
visage of Marty Skinner. Hadn&rsquo;t he talked of
river people as if they were all of a kind? Hadn&rsquo;t
he said they were all crooks and criminals?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Big Joe had put him in that category of river
people, he who had never disobeyed a law in his
young life! He resented it and wanted to say so,
but his better judgment prevailed against it and he
decided to wait and see what kind of people these
river people of Brown&rsquo;s Basin really were. Certainly
if they were all like Big Joe Tully, Skinner
had much to learn.</p>
<p>It was the buxom Mrs. Duffy who decided it, some
moments later. She came in like the fresh morning
breeze from the inlet, clean-aproned and smiling,
laden with soup and eggnog and a wealth of bright
cretonne tucked under her generous arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cretonne curtains for thim little windows, bhoy,&rdquo;
she said breathlessly. &ldquo;Mr. Tully give me the
money for &rsquo;em an&rsquo; I made &rsquo;em up &rsquo;fore I come over.
It&rsquo;ll seem more like home to ye in Brown&rsquo;s Basin
whin ye see &rsquo;em from the outside. The inlet&rsquo;s dismal
enough, so &rsquo;tis, without starin&rsquo; at it through
bare, dirty winders; ain&rsquo;t I right, Mr. Tully?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; Big Joe answered a little abashed.
&ldquo;Women folks know more about thim things, but
even me, I be likin&rsquo; that bright stuff flutterin&rsquo; around
a winder. Ye got the soup an&rsquo; everythin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Duffy&rsquo;s smile was vast and it swept from
Big Joe to the wan-looking Skippy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll pick up, so ye will, or me and Mr. Tully&rsquo;ll
be to blame, Skippy,&rdquo; she said heartily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Skippy almost choked with gratitude. He tried
to speak, but could only think that these were river
people&mdash;his people! Big Joe, who was spending a
lot of money so that his father might have another
chance for freedom and who would spare no expense
to nurse him back to health. And Mrs.
Duffy, who was bringing cheer into the shanty of
the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> and who seemed to care so
much that he get well!</p>
<p><i>River people?</i> Skinner didn&rsquo;t know what he was
talking about! He, Skippy Dare, was proud to be
one of the river people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">MUGS</span></h2>
<p>Many delightful weeks Skippy spent after he was
up and around. Day after day, he and Big Joe
roamed the length and breadth of the river, and
often they went down the bay and across to some
unfrequented beach where they swam and fished to
their hearts&rsquo; content.</p>
<p>Skippy soon showed the effects of his healthful
life and Mrs. Duffy&rsquo;s fine cooking. He was
browned from head to foot and his flat chest had
expanded two inches. And what was more, he had
learned to triumph over tears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>That in itself was a great achievement, for he
had great need to practice self-control during the
fall and the winter following. The gods themselves
seemed to have cast sorrowful glances over
the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> and Skippy&rsquo;s mettle was tried
to the breaking point sometimes, yet always he came
up smiling. Very often it was a poignant smile, the
kind that pierced Big Joe Tully&rsquo;s almost invulnerable
heart and set him to doing all sorts of extravagant
things so that he might see the pain effaced
from the boy&rsquo;s face and hear him laugh happily.</p>
<p>That was why on the evening of Toby&rsquo;s retrial,
Big Joe left the shanty of the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> in
awkward haste. He had left Skippy smiling a smile
so poignant that he could bear it no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Joe,&rdquo; the boy said when they were dawdling
over the most luxurious meal that Tully&rsquo;s money
could buy, &ldquo;it was most like throwin&rsquo; money away,
huh? They don&rsquo;t wanta let Pop get out, I guess.
They can&rsquo;t find the man that really did it and they&rsquo;ve
gotta have somebody so I s&rsquo;pose they think it might&rsquo;s
well be my Pop. Now he <i>will</i> be in for life on account
of the way they tripped him up in his answers.
Gee, how could he remember word for word what
he said at his first trial? People don&rsquo;t remember
word for word &rsquo;bout things like that. Poor Pop
was so nervous I got chills down my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye be gettin&rsquo; down, kid,&rdquo; Tully protested;
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis not sayin&rsquo; we&rsquo;re licked till they turn down an
appeal. We got some more dough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;So much money,&rdquo; said Skippy with a note of
wonder in his high-pitched voice. &ldquo;Gee, Big Joe,
you&rsquo;ve spent so much on Pop an&rsquo; me already. Now
you wanta spend the last you got! Gee whiz, I
can&rsquo;t let you&mdash;<i>I can&rsquo;t</i>! Much as I wanta see Pop
free. It ain&rsquo;t fair lettin&rsquo; you spend all your hard-earned
money....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully had long since learned that he could not
lie to Skippy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; this last coin ain&rsquo;t hard-earned, kid,&rdquo;
he said not a little abashed. &ldquo;So ye see &rsquo;cause it
ain&rsquo;t, it might&rsquo;s well be used for springin&rsquo; your old
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you say it like that,&rdquo; said Skippy
with a slightly reproving smile. Suddenly he
squared his shoulders; then: &ldquo;Anyway, next to Pop,
Big Joe, I like you best. Gee, ain&rsquo;t you been just
like Pop even! So I don&rsquo;t care if that money&rsquo;s not
so straight, but d&rsquo;ye think it&rsquo;ll be lucky for Pop?
Sometimes I wonder if crooked money ain&rsquo;t hard
luck in the end. Maybe when you&rsquo;re broke you can
start over clean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what the breaks&rsquo;ll be bringin&rsquo; this winter,
kid,&rdquo; Big Joe had mumbled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, so we
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was Skippy&rsquo;s answering smile that drove
Big Joe off the barge for a few hours. When he
returned late in the evening, he had a fluffy sort of
bundle in his big arms and an expansive smile on his
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three guesses what&rsquo;s in me arms,&rdquo; he said with
a mischievous wink, standing half in and half out of
the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it dead or alive?&rdquo; Skippy asked chuckling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the liveliest little guy ye ever see.&rdquo; Big
Joe stooped over and released the fluffy bundle from
his arms and presently an Airedale pup put its four
young and rather unsteady legs on the shanty floor.</p>
<p>Skippy laughed out loud. He twisted his hands
together in a gesture of delight, then got to his
knees and coaxed the puppy to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got brown eyes like a reg&rsquo;lar angel,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; brown legs like the divil,&rdquo; Big Joe laughed;
&ldquo;the divil for runnin&rsquo; into mischief. The man what
I bought him from said he was a son-of-a-sufferin&rsquo;
swordfish for runnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; chewin&rsquo;. But he&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo;
better as he gets older, so he will. Ain&rsquo;t he got
the cute little mug though, kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy looked up with shining eyes, then drew the
puppy up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Joe, that&rsquo;s his name&mdash;it&rsquo;s a swell name for
him! Mug&mdash;<i>Mugs</i>, huh? With that funny little
face he couldn&rsquo;t be called anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure, kid. Anythin&rsquo; ye say. Mugs it&rsquo;ll
be, so &rsquo;twill.&rdquo; He coughed. &ldquo;And will he be makin&rsquo;
ye happy now, kid?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Happy!</i> Big Joe, Mugs&rsquo;ll make me happy
&rsquo;cause you bought him to make me laugh. Gee,
gee....&rdquo; Skippy swallowed his emotion. &ldquo;What
for do you do so much, Big Joe?&rdquo; he asked na&iuml;vely.
&ldquo;Gee&mdash;<i>why</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause ye be such a nice kid, so ye be,&rdquo; the man
answered, rumpling Skippy&rsquo;s straight hair. &ldquo;Ye
kind o&rsquo; get under a guy&rsquo;s skin&mdash;ye do that. Ye
seem to be needin&rsquo; somebody for to look after ye,
so ye do, an&rsquo; with Toby not about it might&rsquo;s well be
me.&rdquo; He laughed nervously. &ldquo;Besides I ain&rsquo;t got
nobody else at all, at all, kid, an&rsquo; even a tough guy
like me does be needin&rsquo; company, so he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy hugged the puppy gratefully and he was
so overwhelmed by Tully&rsquo;s generosity that he could
not speak. Never, he thought, did a boy have a
friend like Big Joe!</p>
<p>His cup of happiness would have been filled to the
brim and his father been released that day. But
here again, Big Joe, like an angel of mercy, was
making a last supreme effort to bring his father back
to him. It seemed impossible that such gigantic
effort could fail to bring a joyous result and he told
Tully so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; when Pop gets out,&rdquo; he said in conclusion,
&ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;ll never forget what you&rsquo;ve done an&rsquo; all,
Big Joe. Even now he don&rsquo;t forget it. He said
it&rsquo;s so gloomy and strict in prison that he&rsquo;s sad all
the time, &rsquo;specially &rsquo;cause he was so used to roamin&rsquo;
all over the river free. Gee, he said the feller what
really killed Mr. Flint was a coward &rsquo;cause he must
know how it&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; Pop an&rsquo; me away from each
other an&rsquo; he said he could almost kill him for doin&rsquo;
that alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, the ould man&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; out!&rdquo; said
Tully vehemently. &ldquo;My last grand&rsquo;ll do it, I be
tellin&rsquo; ye! See if it don&rsquo;t! Now ye ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
start worryin&rsquo; all over &rsquo;bout Toby now, are ye?
An&rsquo; me gettin&rsquo; ye Mugs so&rsquo;s to make it aisier like
for ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy looked at the puppy sliding over the floor
on his gawky legs. He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mugs makes up for an awful lot, Big Joe, but
nobody could make up for Pop,&rdquo; he said wistfully.
&ldquo;I never told Pop, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;d think it sounded silly,
but I love him. You know, like I guess girls feel
only they show it an&rsquo; talk about it, but I don&rsquo;t. I
couldn&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;m just tellin&rsquo; you like a secret&mdash;see?
I get a funny pain in my heart when I&rsquo;m not
seein&rsquo; Pop an&rsquo; it gets awful bad when I think maybe
he won&rsquo;t ever get out of prison.&rdquo; Then at the sight
of Big Joe&rsquo;s frowning countenance, he added: &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s like I said, Big Joe, I like you almost as much
as Pop. An&rsquo; now you&rsquo;ve bought me Mugs&mdash;gee,
how much&rsquo;d you pay for him, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Big Joe smiling softly; &ldquo;a
coupla bucks. &rsquo;Course, they cost a little more thin
just muts, but the man at the dog place said thim
Airedales be great for protectin&rsquo; kids so I think
maybe he&rsquo;d be good for ye nights when I might be
out with the boys. He&rsquo;ll be comp&rsquo;ny anyways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later, when Big Joe was having a good-night
smoke alone on the deck, he took out of his
pocket a piece of paper, and in the light gleaming
from the cabin windows he glanced at it curiously.
It was a receipt for one Airedale puppy; price, one
hundred and fifty dollars.</p>
<p>He smiled, shrugged his powerful shoulders and
tearing the paper into bits let it drop in the inlet.
Then he turned his trousers&rsquo; pockets outward and
laughed ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broke,&rdquo; he said half aloud. &ldquo;Sure and &rsquo;tis aisy
come, aisy go. And now for to be gettin&rsquo; some
more dough. The kid&rsquo;ll be needin&rsquo; it so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
shrugged as if getting money was the least of his
troubles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">BAD NEWS</span></h2>
<p>Skippy had food and plenty of it during the next
month. Big Joe saw to that though it kept him
away from the barge many hours at night, hours
when he lived in mortal fear that the boy would
develop a &ldquo;bad throat&rdquo; and be seriously sick before
he could get back.</p>
<p>Skippy&rsquo;s &ldquo;bad throat&rdquo; had become a veritable
bugaboo to Tully and though he had no definite idea
of what it was, the fear of its recurrence stalked
every hour that he spent away from the boy. And
when he did return he would tiptoe into the silent
shanty and up to the boy&rsquo;s bunk, sighing with relief
to find him sleeping quietly. Then, when he had
made sure there was no sign of the pinched look
and feverish cheek, he would climb into his own
bunk with a light on his face that would have surprised
his rough comrades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Skippy saw this light on Tully&rsquo;s face one early
morning. He saw it from under half-opened lids
and it made him glad until he noticed the quick look
of concern that passed over the man&rsquo;s tanned brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Big Joe?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s awake ye be?&rdquo; Big Joe returned nervously.
&ldquo;Well now I was just lookin&rsquo; and seem&rsquo; if
ye was all right. Sure an&rsquo; the weather&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; cold
and all and I got wonderin&rsquo; how the throat was. I
bought a new stove what&rsquo;ll give ye lots o&rsquo; heat&mdash;it&rsquo;s
comin&rsquo; in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; Skippy said gratefully, then:
&ldquo;You sorta looked worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Joe turned his back and started to undress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be tellin&rsquo; ye sometime, kid&mdash;I&mdash;listen....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard about Pop, huh?&rdquo; Skippy sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;they....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They what?&rdquo; said Skippy anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They turned down the appeal. But don&rsquo;t be
takin&rsquo; on about it, Skippy. Sure an&rsquo; next year we&rsquo;ll
be diggin&rsquo; up new evidence. Now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t gonna take on, Big Joe, honest I ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said Skippy bravely. &ldquo;On accounta you I ain&rsquo;t.
You been so good&mdash;all the money you spent tryin&rsquo;
to get Pop free. An&rsquo; now&mdash;well, maybe if I don&rsquo;t
hope about it sumpin&rsquo;ll happen, sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure now that&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; a good kid, takin&rsquo; it so
aisy like. We&rsquo;ll be tryin&rsquo; agin like I said. Some
time Marty Skinner&rsquo;ll get over his crazy notion that
iverybody in Brown&rsquo;s Basin&rsquo;s agin him and that
Toby did the job. Sure he hates iverybody here so
much I hear he&rsquo;s got Buck Flint to agree to buy
the whole inlet. And thin he&rsquo;ll be drivin&rsquo; us squatters
out, so he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Skippy protested indignantly.
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t drive me outa the <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i> &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s Pop&rsquo;s home&mdash;gee, the only home
we got. I gotta stay here till&mdash;well, when I leave
it, I&rsquo;ll know I ain&rsquo;t got any hope that he&rsquo;ll come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t I be knowin&rsquo; how ye feel, kid? But
if Skinner&rsquo;s put it in Buck Flint&rsquo;s head that the inlet&rsquo;s
a good buy and the deal goes through, he&rsquo;ll be
orderin&rsquo; us out and we&rsquo;ll be likin&rsquo; it. Buck ain&rsquo;t a
bad egg, but Skinner&rsquo;s runnin&rsquo; the works and what
he says goes, so it does. Now if he tells us to beat
it I&rsquo;m wonderin&rsquo; who&rsquo;ll be towin&rsquo; a barge out o&rsquo; this
mud whin she&rsquo;s settled. Why, it&rsquo;d take a derrick,
so it would, an&rsquo; even then it&rsquo;d be a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy was deeply affected by this news. He
could not sleep because of it and long after Big Joe
was snoring comfortably he rolled and tossed in his
bunk. Then, after a time, he thought of what
Tully had said about the barges being too deeply
settled in the mud to get them out, and he was so
curious about it that he got up to see for himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>He bundled himself up and slipped out onto the
deck in the cold, damp air of an early fall morning.
It was not yet dawn but the deep black of night had
gone and Brown&rsquo;s Basin lay silent in a dark gray
mist.</p>
<p>Skippy leaned far over aft where the <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i> was settled deepest in the mud. Up forward,
the slinking waters of the inlet gurgled plaintively
against the keel at high tide. Big Joe was
right, he decided with sinking heart; it would take a
derrick and more to pull the barge out of her muddy
berth.</p>
<p>As he started to step back he noticed a tarpaulin
to his right which seemed to be covering some bulky
objects. Something that Big Joe had brought
aboard, he thought, and curiously he raised one end
of it. One glimpse told him enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>They were stolen ships&rsquo; supplies, things that his
father had told him a river pirate could easily dispose
of to some unscrupulous ship captain. Skippy
knew instantly how they had come there and he
turned on his heel and had started back for the
shanty when a searchlight suddenly fell full upon
him.</p>
<p>He crouched out of its glare and needed but to
look hastily up the inlet to see that it was the police
boat bearing down upon the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">DANGER</span></h2>
<p>Feverishly, Skippy set to work and pushed the
stolen goods overboard piece by piece. Most of
them floated but a moment, then sank out of sight,
and the rest floated at a safe enough distance from
the oncoming launch to escape the eyes of the police.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/im5.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="775" />
<p class="pcap">FEVERISHLY SKIPPY PUSHED THE STOLEN GOODS OVERBOARD.</p>
</div>
<p>When the last piece had been disposed of he
rushed to the shanty, awakened Big Joe and told
him what he had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a good boy ye be, Skippy,&rdquo; he praised.
&ldquo;Sure th&rsquo; bulls give me a chase tonight so they did
and I couldn&rsquo; unload the goods on me customer so
I brought thim here till tomorrow night. Ye&rsquo;re
a broth of a lad to be droppin&rsquo; thim over, so ye be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; said Skippy, frightened. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that them
boardin&rsquo; us now?&rdquo; He got out of his clothes and
back into his bunk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>They listened in silence while the soft tramp of
feet came along the deck. Skippy had reason to
remember another terrible occasion when the police
boat had come to take his father. He had thought
then that it was only for a day.</p>
<p>He had only Big Joe now, his only friend in a
singularly callous world. Would the law take him
too? He couldn&rsquo;t bear it&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t bear it!
He would like and protect Big Joe even if he was a
murderer, the police wouldn&rsquo;t take the one thing he
had left!</p>
<p>They knocked insistently and Big Joe padded to
the door, barefooted and feigning complete surprise.
He invited them in, hurried ponderously to
the rickety table and lighted the lamp. Mugs
growled ominously.</p>
<p>The officers told Tully that a certain warehouse
had been broken into that night. The watchman
who had surprised the intruder thought he had
recognized Big Joe Tully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight?&rdquo; Skippy piped up from his bunk.
&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t so &rsquo;cause Big Joe&rsquo;s been here takin&rsquo; care of
me since noon. I got one of my bad throats again
an&rsquo; he wouldn&rsquo;t go out &rsquo;cause I was feelin&rsquo; so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Who of the river front police hadn&rsquo;t heard of
Skippy Dare&rsquo;s bad throat? None that had patrolled
the harbor during the past four months.
Hadn&rsquo;t it been because of his frail boy that Toby
Dare had fought his prison sentence so hard? The
papers had been full of it too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the throat&rsquo;s cutting up again, eh Skippy?&rdquo;
asked Inspector Jones. He was the same man who
had taken Toby away from his son.</p>
<p>Skippy, always a bit wan looking when he lay in
his bunk, looked more wan than ever then. His
pallor was not simulated; it was terribly real, for
he was not only frightened at the prospect of losing
Big Joe; he was frightened because of the barefaced
lie he had just told&mdash;the first in his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always gotta be careful of my throat, Mister,&rdquo;
he said to the officer when the worst of his emotion
had passed. &ldquo;&rsquo;Specially when it gets cold. Sometimes
I get fever right away an&rsquo; the doctor told Big
Joe the last time that I gotta right away have attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and the lad&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Big Joe interposed
with genuine feeling in his voice, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got only me
to be lookin&rsquo; after him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you doing for a living, Big Joe?&rdquo; asked
the officer a little pointedly.</p>
<p>Big Joe stifled a yawn and sat down on a chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; he asked innocently. &ldquo;Ye mean what&rsquo;ll
I do when the money I saved from me barge gives
out, is it? With the way Flint blackballed me &rsquo;fore
he died, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to be workin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the
bay next summer, so I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got enough for you and the kid till next summer?&rdquo;
the officer persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and &rsquo;tis lucky I have, the way things be,&rdquo;
answered Big Joe.</p>
<p>The officer leveled his eyes at Tully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the kid&rsquo;s sake, watch your step, Big Joe,&rdquo;
he said with a warning note. &ldquo;For the kid&rsquo;s
sake....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy couldn&rsquo;t believe they had gone. It
seemed too good to be true, and in order to reassure
him, Big Joe put something around him and went
out on deck to see that the launch had actually gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure she&rsquo;s aisy out to the river by this time,&rdquo; he
assured Skippy when he came back. He lighted a
cigarette and sat down. &ldquo;Now was that a close
shave I&rsquo;ll be askin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And I can be
thankin&rsquo; ye for it, kid. I never expected thim to
come stealin&rsquo; up on us here, no, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;See it don&rsquo;t pay, Big Joe!&rdquo; Skippy said gently.
He seemed spent with the great strain. &ldquo;People
know a big guy like you anywheres an&rsquo; besides like I
say, it don&rsquo;t pay anyhow. Gee, if you can&rsquo;t get honest
work &rsquo;cause Flint blackballed you then I gotta
work myself. I can get a job as office boy in a
warehouse. I bet I can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix, kid, nix, ye ain&rsquo;t well enough,&rdquo; Big Joe protested
hotly. &ldquo;Besides I don&rsquo;t niver take things
from folks what are hard up, Skippy. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemme try it, Big Joe, huh? I&rsquo;m better now&rsquo;n
I been in a long time, so lemme try it! I&rsquo;m not
kickin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout you. Gee, I can see how it is now.
Even Pop once told me how hard it was for a blackballed
man to get back along the river. You spent
all your money on Pop an&rsquo; me an&rsquo; we hadda eat an&rsquo;
live, so what was you gonna do! I shoulda known
before that your money couldn&rsquo;t last forever&mdash;gee!
All you&rsquo;ve done for me, Big Joe&mdash;lemme try!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully was still protesting at daylight, but Skippy,
having made up his mind, fell peacefully to sleep
with the dog tucked snugly under his outstretched
arm. Big Joe sat watching them until long after
the sun came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and the kid lied for me,&rdquo; he said as he
climbed back into his bunk. &ldquo;Sure and that nice kid
lied for me&mdash;<i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as his large features settled in slumber, they
looked strangely troubled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">A JOB</span></h2>
<p>Skippy left the barge noiselessly that morning
and did not return until six o&rsquo;clock in the evening.
Consequently, Big Joe spent a troubled day, waiting
and hoping and fearing. When he saw the boy
crossing the plank from the <i>Dinky O. Cross</i>, he hurried
to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where have ye been, Skippy?&rdquo; he called
anxiously. &ldquo;Here and ye been havin&rsquo; me crazy
wonderin&rsquo; if ye&rsquo;d run away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy laughed and greeted Mugs who seemed
to be growing by the minute. Then he swung energetically
into the shanty and sat down to a hot supper
that Mrs. Duffy had faithfully sent over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess what, Big Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and ye&rsquo;ll not be for quittin&rsquo; me &rsquo;cause o&rsquo;
what happened last night?&rdquo; Big Joe returned trying
not to sound anxious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not. Whad&rsquo;ye think I am? I
ain&rsquo;t yeller, Big Joe. Besides I like you too much.
What I wanta say is, I got a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t gonna be hard,&rdquo; Skippy assured him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the new office boy at the Central Warehouse
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll get ten bucks a week. So now you needn&rsquo;t
be scareda cops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully smiled in spite of himself. &ldquo;My now, ain&rsquo;t
that just fine. Ain&rsquo;t that just fine, kid. But do ye
be knowin&rsquo; who&rsquo;s boss o&rsquo; the Central?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marty Skinner, actin&rsquo; as Buck Flint&rsquo;s agent, no
less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he can see then that my Pop brought me
up honest an&rsquo; hard workin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Skippy after a moment&rsquo;s
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, to be sure and he can that, but shiverin&rsquo;
swordfish, don&rsquo;t ye be goin&rsquo; on expectin&rsquo; too much
from him, kid. D&rsquo;ye be thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s wise ye be on
the payroll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, just ye be waitin&rsquo; till he is. Just ye
be....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Skippy did not have long to wait. He had completed
his first week&rsquo;s work in the Central Warehouse
when one day he heard a hushed voice pass
around the awesome news that &ldquo;the boss&rdquo; was coming.</p>
<p>Skinner recognized Skippy as soon as he stepped
into the room. There were a few questions asked
and Skippy trudged back to the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>
that night with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Big Joe was all sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was he sayin&rsquo; to ye, kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted to know how I come to get a job
there,&rdquo; Skippy answered dolefully. &ldquo;Wanted to
know how I had nerve enough an&rsquo; said I was there
as a spotter for my father&rsquo;s gang probably. An&rsquo;
before he finished he said it was lucky there hadn&rsquo;t
been a robbery there or he&rsquo;d handed me right over
to the police then an&rsquo; there. <i>Me</i>&mdash;me that ain&rsquo;t
done him a bitta harm an&rsquo; that wouldn&rsquo;t! Gee, Big
Joe, ain&rsquo;t it enough that he helped put Pop where
he is? Can&rsquo;t he see how <i>I</i> am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None o&rsquo; &rsquo;em can see anythin&rsquo;, kid,&rdquo; Big Joe answered,
bitterly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble with me and
Toby and every man in this Basin. Sure &rsquo;tis &rsquo;cause
the likes o&rsquo; Skinner can&rsquo;t see. They don&rsquo;t even give
us a chance, they don&rsquo;t &rsquo;cause we&rsquo;re river folks.
They tell us so much that we&rsquo;re crooked that we
wind up that way whither we want to or not, so we
do. They make us be crooked. And now they be
startin&rsquo; in on you, kid. &rsquo;Tis a dirty shame, so &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some other place,&rdquo; Skippy was defiant.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not gonna make me crooked when I don&rsquo;t
wanna be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skippy, kid,&rdquo; thought Tully from the depths of
his river front wisdom, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure, I ain&rsquo;t so
sure.&rdquo; But what he said was: &ldquo;Sure and that
they&rsquo;ll not, Skippy me boy, that they&rsquo;ll not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">WHAT NEXT?</span></h2>
<p>Weary week after weary week passed for Skippy
until the winter months had come and gone.
March arrived, cold, blustery and disappointing,
for he hadn&rsquo;t yet been able to hold a job longer than
it took his employers to find out just who their
office boy was. And as gossip spreads quickly along
the river front, the discouraged boy seldom drew
more than a few days&rsquo; pay at a time.</p>
<p>He had learned upon being dismissed from his
last job the reason why employers had no use for his
services. He demanded to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it &rsquo;cause my father&rsquo;s in prison?&rdquo; he asked
wistfully. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause if it is nobody is fair in the
world. You&rsquo;ve heard, I bet, that lots of innocent
people are in jail so can&rsquo;t you believe maybe my
father could be one of them? And anyway, does
that prove that I&rsquo;m....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The employer, thus confronted, protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said in that self-righteous tone that was
beginning to wear on Skippy&rsquo;s nerves, &ldquo;we think
that you, yourself, mean to be honest but we know
that you can&rsquo;t hold out long against such home conditions
as the Basin offers. A wage such as a boy
like you with your limited education can earn isn&rsquo;t
enough to provide you with all you want. And
sooner or later, your association with a person like
Big Joe Tully will have its effect on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Pop was gonna send me to school so&rsquo;s I
could get educated,&rdquo; Skippy protested, &ldquo;but anyway
I&rsquo;m honest an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m gonna stay honest, no matter
what you think. Besides, Big Joe&rsquo;s tried to live
straight all this winter for my sake, but are you an&rsquo;
everybody else I&rsquo;ve tried to work for tryin&rsquo; to help
him? No, nobody won&rsquo;t even give him a job so he
can stay straight. An&rsquo; now you won&rsquo;t let me stay
&rsquo;cause I live with him, because you&rsquo;re afraid....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; the employer interposed patronizingly,
&ldquo;can you blame us? Tully has served a jail
sentence for robbing our warehouses. How can we
be certain that he won&rsquo;t do it again? Or that he
won&rsquo;t use your position of trust in our offices to
learn more easily what goods we have in our warehouses
that he can steal? What assurance can you
give us that he don&rsquo;t do that when he gets tired
treading the straight and narrow path? None.
Absolutely none! No, we warehouse owners have
been too long aware that it is you thieving river people
who are responsible for our tremendous losses
every year. And so we maintain that, once a thief,
always a thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy was wounded and bitter. His full, generous
lips curled sardonically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it ain&rsquo;t any use to try to make you understand,&rdquo;
he said bravely. &ldquo;You warehouse people
complain that we&rsquo;re thieves an&rsquo; you make us thieves
just like you&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; to make me one by keepin&rsquo; me
outa jobs so&rsquo;s I can&rsquo;t make an honest livin&rsquo;. An&rsquo;
anyway, if the only way I could hold a job is to quit
Big Joe then I won&rsquo;t do it! I&rsquo;d rather <i>be</i> a thief,
yes I would! He saved my life and he&rsquo;s helped my
Pop ... oh, what&rsquo;s the use!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slammed the door behind him and rushed
home to find Big Joe with his faithful, smiling face.
Plank after plank he hurried over, connecting the
barges, and at last he crossed the deck of the <i>Dinky
O. Cross</i>, waved a greeting to the smiling Mrs.
Duffy and whistled for Mugs when he reached the
plank of the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have ye lost the job, kid?&rdquo; Big Joe asked
when he entered the shanty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;My last job, Big Joe,&rdquo; the boy answered smiling
ruefully. &ldquo;You were right about &rsquo;em&mdash;there
ain&rsquo;t one that&rsquo;ll gimme a chance. Even you who
ain&rsquo;t always been honest yourself did more than
that! You let me try at least. They know more
about you than I did&mdash;they know you served time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re blackballin&rsquo; ye, is it?
&rsquo;Cause ye&rsquo;re stickin&rsquo; with me?&rdquo; His bland face
looked dark and ominous. Then as he glanced at
the boy&rsquo;s wistful countenance, his expression softened:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye the truth, kid, whin I say that
they railroaded me, so they did&mdash;I was startin&rsquo; in
honest like you. Office boy. Thin one night the
warehouse was robbed and next mornin&rsquo; they accused
me o&rsquo; workin&rsquo; with the gang&mdash;tippin&rsquo; &rsquo;em off.
&rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;d been seen &rsquo;round with one o&rsquo; the guys
what was caught. I got a year, I did, and didn&rsquo;t
have a chance. When I come out I was blackballed
and Ol&rsquo; Flint took me under. Sufferin&rsquo; swordfish,
sure and I&rsquo;ve tried twice now to travel on the up and
up. When I first got my barge and now. And &rsquo;tis
no use, &rsquo;tis no use.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems that way,&rdquo; Skippy murmured, disconsolate.
&ldquo;Now I ain&rsquo;t gonna try. I&rsquo;m gonna live an&rsquo;
eat like other fellers my age. I wanta go to the
movies an&rsquo; take things up to Pop when I go to see
him. Gee, already he&rsquo;s startin&rsquo; to write to me that
the food&rsquo;s bad up at the big house. So I gotta help
him have a little sumpin&rsquo; to smile at if he&rsquo;s gonna be
there the rest of his life! An&rsquo; I gotta have money
to go to see him&mdash;I gotta see him! If they won&rsquo;t
lemme earn it honest&mdash;<i>what else</i>? Like the man
said, I don&rsquo;t know enough to work anywheres else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ye&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; to quit me, kid? Ye&rsquo;ll be
wantin&rsquo; to go away and start over where they don&rsquo;t
know &rsquo;bout river people and all?&rdquo; Big Joe&rsquo;s anxiety
was pathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of places too far away from the
river,&rdquo; Skippy admitted. &ldquo;I guess I got the river
in me like Pop, huh? I ain&rsquo;t got nerve enough to
break away. Besides I sorta promised Pop I&rsquo;d stay
by the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>. S&rsquo;pose just by a lucky
break the governor pardons Pop some day, huh?
He&rsquo;s paid good money for this barge an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s the
only home he&rsquo;s got. Besides, I don&rsquo;t wanta quit
you, Big Joe&mdash;<i>I couldn&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Skippy&rsquo;s decision stood until Brown&rsquo;s Basin
was no more....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">BIG JOE&rsquo;S IDEA</span></h2>
<p>In May, Big Joe conceived a brilliant idea for
making a living. He came into the shanty of the
barge with it one balmy noon, for it was embodied
in a large canvas bag which he carried in his big
outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and now we be goin&rsquo; to eat, kid, and we be
goin&rsquo; to live high, and ye be goin&rsquo; to do all the things
ye&rsquo; want for Toby,&rdquo; he said chuckling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stealin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Skippy asked, looking worried and
wan. &ldquo;As hard up as we been, Big Joe, I can&rsquo;t
stand for sneakin&rsquo; down the river at night an&rsquo; climbin&rsquo;
into warehouse windows. Gee, Pop&rsquo;d feel fierce
if we was caught an&rsquo; I was put in reform school or
sumpin&rsquo; like that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;And d&rsquo;ye be thinkin&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t carin&rsquo; no more for
ye than seein&rsquo; ye grabbed for somethin&rsquo; like that,
me boy? Kid, I been thinkin&rsquo; and thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; some
way for us to be gettin&rsquo; by&mdash;some way that no copper
could catch us up on. And if they iver should
&rsquo;twon&rsquo;t be you what&rsquo;d be holdin&rsquo; the bag&mdash;&rsquo;twill be
me, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m the one what&rsquo;ll do the trick. Do
you catch on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What trick, Big Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the stuff I got in this bag, kid,&rdquo; answered
Tully softly. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis ground carbon and whin it&rsquo;s
poured in with oil it raises the divil with thim nice
engines in rich guys&rsquo; boats up at the Riverview
Yacht Club. From now on till the end o&rsquo; summer
they&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; trips&mdash;see? Well, sure and Big Joe&rsquo;s
got a good pal what looks out for the boats up
there ... he&rsquo;s told beforehand what rich guy&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
out in his boat, he is ... my pal tells me and
I go up there&mdash;see? Him and me edge aisy like
towards the boat and whilst he&rsquo;s lookin&rsquo; out the corners
o&rsquo; his eye that no one&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;, Big Joe uncovers
the crank case and &rsquo;fore ye could say <i>scat</i>,
I&rsquo;m pourin&rsquo; me little powder in the breather pipe
and sure she&rsquo;s mixin&rsquo; with the oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what then?&rdquo; Skippy asked, nervous, yet admiring
Big Joe&rsquo;s ingenious idea.</p>
<p>Big Joe winked, then laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I pour the right amount o&rsquo; this powder,
kid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thin I beats it off quick and watch the
rich guy start, so I do. If &rsquo;tis possible, me pal finds
out where the guy&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; so&rsquo;s I can beat it on ahead
and circle his course so I come up on him by the
time his ingine&rsquo;s dead&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The powder mixes through the oil an&rsquo; up
through the engine, huh?&rdquo; Skippy asked fearfully.
&ldquo;Makes the engine go dead, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure &rsquo;tis ground up like nobody&rsquo;s business, kid,&rdquo;
Big Joe laughed. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I make sure o&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; in
enough so&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll be knowin&rsquo; about where the ingine
goes dead on thim. And thin I chug up to thim all
innocent like and asks do they want help. <i>Do</i>
they? Sure they must be towed back so I says I
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m their man &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ll be losin&rsquo; business
somewheres or other&mdash;see? And they&rsquo;re so
anxious they&rsquo;ll be willin&rsquo; to pay me price, so they
will. And I gotta be paid for the loss o&rsquo; me time!&rdquo;
He laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;gee, in a way that&rsquo;s worse than pulling a
warehouse, Big Joe? It ain&rsquo;t so dangerous,
but....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, sure I thought ye&rsquo;d be takin&rsquo; on, but I can
tell ye it ain&rsquo;t so bad at all, at all. I&rsquo;ll be pickin&rsquo;
out only thim what&rsquo;s payin&rsquo; tin and twinty grand for
their kickers! What&rsquo;s the cost to thim what throws
away hundreds o&rsquo; bucks at a time? And what&rsquo;s
fifty or seventy-five bucks for to be payin&rsquo; me for
towin&rsquo; thim back? Sure &rsquo;tis a drop in the bucket,
says I. They&rsquo;ll niver be missin&rsquo; it, kid. And we
gotta live, you and me, and Toby&rsquo;s case&rsquo;s gotta go
before the governor some day and that takes money
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy nodded and Big Joe noticed that the old
pinched look had come back to his thin cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, ye can&rsquo;t be goin&rsquo; on like this, you and me!&rdquo;
he pleaded. &ldquo;Like I said &rsquo;tis only the big guys&mdash;guys
what have the heavy sugar. We&rsquo;ll be layin&rsquo;
off the others and we&rsquo;ll be workin&rsquo; the different clubs
so nobody gets wise. Thim boat tenders&rsquo;ll go
along for a little o&rsquo; the split. So ye needn&rsquo;t be
worryin&rsquo; that we&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; thim what can&rsquo;t afford
it! Besides they&rsquo;re mostly rich warehouse guys
that won&rsquo;t give you and me the chance for honest
work. Sure and now ye won&rsquo;t be feelin&rsquo; so bad
about takin&rsquo; it, will ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That decided Skippy. Hunger and privation
had dulled his conscience, embittered him against
the warehouse owners and he was at last ready to
strike back at his oppressors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>And strange to say, in contemplating the results
of this stealthy enterprise, Skippy did not think of
the food, nor the movies to which he could go. He
was thinking instead that he would at last have the
money to pay for his journey up to see his father.
For a few golden moments the walls of the prison
would fade away and Toby would imagine himself
a free man. And all because of a breath of river
air that his son would bring him in his smile.</p>
<p>And for that, Skippy was willing to forget that
he hated dishonesty in any form.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">ANOTHER JOB</span></h2>
<p>It was early morning a few days later when
Skippy and Tully set out on the first stage of their
enterprise. The inlet was dark and shadowy, and
the sweet soft breath of spring floated about their
heads. In its wake, however, came the smell of
mud and fish at low tide and the boy was glad to get
out into the fresh salt air of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing that makes me hate the inlet,&rdquo;
he said to Big Joe as they turned up toward the
yacht club. &ldquo;I get feelin&rsquo; choked, sorta&mdash;you
know, sumpin&rsquo; like I imagine people feel when they
go to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t ye be feelin&rsquo; spooky,&rdquo; Tully admonished.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t the spirit for a job like this.
Sure, there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout mentionin&rsquo; jail what
gives me the creeps. So don&rsquo;t be thinkin&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll be
gettin&rsquo; in any jams&mdash;&rsquo;tis hard luck, so &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Big Joe,&rdquo; said Skippy contritely. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t say it for that, honest, because even Pop
can tell you how the inlet always made me feel like
that. I&rsquo;m all right when I&rsquo;m up on the barge; it&rsquo;s
only the inlet makes me feel that way. Just as soon
as we strike the river I feel better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk, me boy. And I&rsquo;m sorry for
jumpin&rsquo; on ye so quick. I thought ye was nervous
&rsquo;bout this job, so I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, no,&rdquo; Skippy protested, but his quivering lip
belied his words.</p>
<p>Tully did not see it, however, for he was intent
on approaching the yacht club unobtrusively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if this ain&rsquo;t a good break,&rdquo; he said enthusiastically.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a party o&rsquo; three goin&rsquo; out on
a two days&rsquo; fishing trip at Snug Island. She&rsquo;s called
the <i>Minnehaha</i>, me pal tells me, and she&rsquo;s a baby.
Twenty-six footer! Guy that owns her is Crosley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crosley Warehouse where I worked last?&rdquo;
Skippy asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and now don&rsquo;t that beat all! Little Old
Lady Luck&rsquo;s playin&rsquo; with us, kid! Sure &rsquo;tis a break
to make him hand over his bucks or sink in Watson&rsquo;s
Channel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em do that, Big Joe?&rdquo; Skippy
asked fearfully. &ldquo;<i>You wouldn&rsquo;t!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nah, Big Joe ain&rsquo;t that hard hearted, much as
I got it in for thim rich bugs. I&rsquo;ll just be lettin&rsquo;
thim think I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; thim a favor not lettin&rsquo; Watson&rsquo;s
Channel close &rsquo;em in, so I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you s&rsquo;pose Mr. Crosley&rsquo;ll get wise we&rsquo;re
doin&rsquo; it a-purpose?&rdquo; Skippy was beginning to
weaken already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;ll he be doin&rsquo; that, I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; ye? Me
pal tipped me off they be due at dawn. We&rsquo;ll be
there and gone a half hour afore they show up. So
don&rsquo;t be startin&rsquo; worryin&rsquo;, kid. Leave everythin&rsquo;
to Big Joe, as if ye didn&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout the
business at all, at all. You don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;. Be
lookin&rsquo; dumb if anybody talks to ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Skippy, half-whimsically, and half-frightened.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be <i>scared</i> dumb so you needn&rsquo;t
worry that I&rsquo;ll get nervous an&rsquo; give anythin&rsquo; away&mdash;gee
whiz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Joe laughed, then he said, &ldquo;Awright, kid,
D&rsquo;ye be knowin&rsquo; Skinner and Crosley be pals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said Skippy. &ldquo;Now I know why I
couldn&rsquo;t get a job. Skinner put &rsquo;em all wise, huh?
Gee!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>They were silent after that and chugged steadily
toward the yacht club. A ferry-boat was crossing
far up the river and her lights blinked out over the
dark water like a hundred evil eyes. Hundreds of
boats anchored near shore bobbed up and down on
the tide like a ghostly river army, and from the
shore more lights winked down on them knowingly
as if they knew their secret.</p>
<p>They crept into the slip alongside the yacht club;
Big Joe had shut off the motor. At a sign from
him, Skippy dropped the anchor and without a
word, he got out and crept across the float and onto
the club grounds.</p>
<p>After the darkness hid him from view Skippy
looked about, nervously. There was a little light
gleaming from under the vast clubhouse porch and
suddenly he saw Big Joe&rsquo;s ponderous figure pass
under it. Presently, he halted and held out his
hand to a man approaching him from the other direction.</p>
<p>Skippy sighed with relief and relaxed. At least
Big Joe had met his comrade without accident. Besides,
no one seemed to be about. He heard not a
sound except the river lapping restlessly around the
piling under the slip and the swish of anchored craft
as they swayed on the tide.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that Big Joe was staying an interminable
time, but as an actual fact, it was just
seven minutes before he saw the man&rsquo;s bulky figure
coming stealthily toward him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Skippy weighed anchor without a sound and they
pushed the kicker out of the slip with oars. A little
distance below the club, Big Joe turned over his
motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shiverin&rsquo; swordfish, kid,&rdquo; he murmured with a
chuckle, &ldquo;all we do now is wait&mdash;wait so&rsquo;s Crosley
can get &rsquo;bout as far as Watson&rsquo;s Channel. He&rsquo;ll
be gettin&rsquo; no further&rsquo;n that&mdash;so he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy shivered a little and leaned over the
coaming to watch for logs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">ANOTHER RESCUE</span></h2>
<p>As the moments wore on, Skippy felt meaner
than ever. He tried to force himself to accept Big
Joe&rsquo;s point of view, but it was difficult and more
than once he wished he had not encouraged his good
friend in this dubious enterprise.</p>
<p>They chugged into the bay and out of the awakening
river traffic. Dawn had broken through and
glimmerings of dancing light peeped over the horizon.
An hour more and they would be in sight
of Watson&rsquo;s Channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not be goin&rsquo; straight for the Channel,
we&rsquo;ll not,&rdquo; called Big Joe as if anticipating Skippy&rsquo;s
fears. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be layin&rsquo; quite like below here a
ways &rsquo;till the <i>Minnehaha</i> gets in the Channel. &rsquo;Tis
a funny name, hey kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; Skippy answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Indian name,
Big Joe&mdash;I think it means sumpin&rsquo; like Laughing&mdash;Laughing
sumpin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Joe&rsquo;s mirth knew no bounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and just about now <i>Minnie</i> ain&rsquo;t laughin&rsquo;,
she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; Skippy said gloomily. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
laugh ... not till after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later they were chugging noisily toward
Watson&rsquo;s Channel. The sun was glorious and the
water glistened under its warm spring rays. Gulls
frolicked about in the foaming spray and Skippy
tried hard to believe there was nothing but peace in
his busy mind.</p>
<p>After a time they heard a distant sound, faint at
first but growing louder within a few minutes.
Tully grinned at Skippy&rsquo;s questioning face and
nodded as the piercing note of a siren cut the silent
sunlit air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and I wonder what that might be?&rdquo; he
said with mock-seriousness. &ldquo;Sounds like distress
I&rsquo;d be sayin&rsquo;, I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop kiddin&rsquo;, Big Joe,&rdquo; Skippy pleaded. &ldquo;You
mean you think it&rsquo;s <i>them</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now I wouldn&rsquo; be s&rsquo;prised,&rdquo; the big fellow
answered. Then seriously, he said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo;
there, kid! Don&rsquo;t be lookin&rsquo; as if they was
drownin&rsquo; or somethin&rsquo;. Sure they could keep afloat
for hours so they could, and look at the tide besides.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Skippy glanced at the quietly rolling swell and felt
somewhat reassured. But the voice of the siren
jarred him and he was glad to see that Big Joe
looked serious and determined. He hadn&rsquo;t liked
that note of raillery in his friend&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>But despite Skippy&rsquo;s fears Tully answered the
siren call with all the haste of a good Samaritan.
One might have supposed that he gloried in the
duties of heroic service. And when he reached the
Channel and they sighted the distressed launch, he
opened wide his throttle until the old hull shook to
the vibrations of the engine.</p>
<p>Skippy clenched his slim, brown fingers and sat
tense in his seat while a spray rained into the boat.
Big Joe coughed significantly and drove his ramshackle
craft straight for the disabled cruiser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ain&rsquo;t she the sweet lookin&rsquo; baby,&rdquo; he observed
as if he had never seen the launch before.</p>
<p>Skippy said nothing but grimly watched the three
men who awaited their coming. Crosley he recognized
at once, but the man standing alongside of
him was a stranger. The third occupant of the
<i>Minnehaha</i> was Marty Skinner. Skippy remembered
him from his father&rsquo;s trial and from the night
Skinner had ordered him off the <i>Apollyon</i> without
a hearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see him?&rdquo; he asked Big Joe between
clenched teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all the better,&rdquo; Big Joe seemed to say in his
bland smile.</p>
<p>He brought the kicker up alongside the <i>Minnehaha</i>
and laid a life preserver over the coaming of
his boat to prevent its scratching the gleaming hull
of the launch. Skippy scrambled to the rescue and
held the kicker as the ill-assorted pair rocked and
rubbed in the heavy swell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I don&rsquo;t want to be scratchin&rsquo; her,&rdquo; said
Tully with a fine assumption of humble respect for
the launch. &ldquo;I was tellin&rsquo; the kid here, she&rsquo;s some
baby, hey? What&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; the matter; power give
out did she? &rsquo;Tis too bad, so &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy kept his eyes on space, but he had the feeling
that Big Joe and he were being scrutinized with
unfriendly stares.</p>
<p>Crosley sniffed the air contemptuously before he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s pumping oil to beat the band,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t seem to be getting any compression
either. We can&rsquo;t get a kick out of her. Been flopping
around for an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure maybe ye be needin&rsquo; new rings,&rdquo; said Tully.
&ldquo;Guess ye been pushin&rsquo; her too hard, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>He glanced into the cockpit and with a fine show
of rueful astonishment, beheld the disastrous results
of his own handiwork. She was indeed pumping
oil. The engine head was covered with it, and it
was streaming down the side over the carburetor.
Three or four spark plugs had been taken out and
lay on a locker in little puddles of oozy muck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If &rsquo;t was only one cylinder now, I&rsquo;d be sayin&rsquo; ye
had a busted ring, or even a cracked piston,&rdquo; Tully
said blandly. &ldquo;But shiverin&rsquo; swordfish if it don&rsquo;t
look like the whole six o&rsquo; thim, don&rsquo;t it? Ye can&rsquo;t
do nothin&rsquo; here. Looks like ye was racin&rsquo; her a
lot.&rdquo; His detestable device had worked so well
that he seemed moved to offer gratuitous suggestions.
&ldquo;I knowed a guy was stuck on the bar over
by Inland Beach and he kept racin&rsquo; his motor, and
somehow&mdash;I dunno just how&mdash;she sucked in a lot o&rsquo;
beach sand and it sanded down his cylinder wall
good an&rsquo; plenty, so it did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skinner&rsquo;s lips were drawn in a thin line above his
pointed chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean we&rsquo;ll have to be towed back,
Crosley?&rdquo; he asked his host petulantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid so, Marty,&rdquo; answered Crosley. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
imagine how a fine engine like mine could break
down so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and if that ain&rsquo;t just like some guys,&rdquo; said
Tully glibly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re fine&rsquo;s a fiddle one day and
the next&mdash;they&rsquo;re done for, ain&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crosley nodded indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you tow us in?&rdquo; he asked as if the question
were distasteful. His aversion to the uncouth,
but amiable river man was too obvious to escape
Skippy&rsquo;s sensitive eyes.</p>
<p>If Tully was aware of it too, he did not betray it.
His face looked grave and thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble is I&rsquo;m due at the Hook,&rdquo; he said hesitantly.
&ldquo;Have an all day&rsquo;s job towin&rsquo; a barge.
I&rsquo;m late as &rsquo;tis. And if I ain&rsquo;t there in twinty minutes
I lose the job, so I do. &rsquo;Tis the first good payin&rsquo;
job I&rsquo;ve had in a long....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crosley waved his hand in entreaty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see that you&rsquo;re paid for the loss of your
day&rsquo;s job, man. How much would you get for it,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully moved his large head and shrugged his
powerful shoulders. &ldquo;Seventy-five bucks is what
they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to pay me,&rdquo; he said modestly.</p>
<p>Crosley gasped audibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of money, but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hold up!&rdquo; snapped Skinner between his
tightly drawn lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and it&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re payin&rsquo; me, boss,&rdquo; said
Big Joe with a look of hurt pride. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t askin&rsquo;
ye&rsquo; for a cent, I&rsquo;m not considerin&rsquo; I may lose my
customer for future jobs. &rsquo;Tis not only I&rsquo;m losin&rsquo;
that seventy-five bucks, &rsquo;tis....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Crosley sniffed angrily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
taking advantage of us. I don&rsquo;t believe you can
earn seventy-five dollars for a day&rsquo;s work. But
you have us at a disadvantage&mdash;the Lord knows
who else we could get to our rescue in this unfrequented
channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So and that&rsquo;s all the thanks I get,&rdquo; said Tully.
&ldquo;Comin&rsquo; way out o&rsquo; me way....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Skinner interposed. &ldquo;Give it to
him, Crosley. I know who this fellow is. We&rsquo;re
at his mercy. But I&rsquo;ll remember this, Tully&mdash;you&rsquo;re
occupying the mud banks at Brown&rsquo;s Basin.
You and this boy, Dare, may want some consideration
when you people have to get out of the Basin.
And I&rsquo;ll remember who&rsquo;s living on the <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughta!&rdquo; Skippy shouted angrily, rising
to his feet. &ldquo;Your cheatin&rsquo; boss what&rsquo;s dead put it
there, that&rsquo;s what, an&rsquo; my father&rsquo;ll never see the sun
on the river again on account of it too! So try an&rsquo;
take it away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Skinner&rsquo;s cold dignity seemed unruffled. He
averted his gaze while Crosley counted out seventy-five
dollars to Big Joe Tully. Skippy stood by, his
heart full of hate, and at that moment he thought
that he could cheerfully see the <i>Minnehaha</i> sink to
the bottom of the Channel while Skinner begged
to be saved.</p>
<p>While leisurely chugging back toward the Basin
that afternoon he and Tully talked it over seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and we got seventy-five bucks aisy money
out o&rsquo; the tightwads,&rdquo; Tully chuckled in conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five bucks an&rsquo; the promise of trouble
from Skinner, Big Joe,&rdquo; Skippy reminded him with
a note of apprehension in his voice.</p>
<p>Tully&rsquo;s face darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate Skinner for sayin&rsquo; what he did, so I do,&rdquo;
he said ominously. &ldquo;Sufferin&rsquo; swordfish if he do be
makin&rsquo; ye scared and drivin&rsquo; ye outa the only home
ye got&mdash;well, he better be lettin&rsquo; ye &rsquo;lone. <i>Me</i>, I
don&rsquo;t care much where I live, but <i>you</i> ... I&rsquo;ll be
fixin&rsquo; him if he....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, Big Joe!&rdquo; Skippy pleaded earnestly.
&ldquo;It scares me, &rsquo;cause that&rsquo;s just what Pop
said the night he went to see old Mr. Flint on the
<i>Apollyon</i>! It&rsquo;s sorta&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;tis all right, kid, so &rsquo;tis.&rdquo; Tully smiled.
&ldquo;Now ye be forgettin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy tried to; certainly he had forgotten that
he himself had wished Marty Skinner a like fate
only that morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">DAVY JONES</span></h2>
<p>Tully&rsquo;s game worked successfully for the next
few weeks, for he had distributed his activities
among various club houses dotting the shore. It
had become an enterprise apparently without threat
of untoward incident&mdash;so much so that Skippy, with
his uncanny knack of presaging ill, came to feel that
they must not go on with the distasteful business.</p>
<p>He had hated the treachery of it from the very
beginning, partly because of his innate honesty and
also because in fairness to himself, he knew he had
no real grudge against his rich fellow men. And
in his vague, ignorant way Skippy knew that Skinner
and Crosley represented something which hate
could never successfully combat.</p>
<p>He felt it particularly one early morning when
Tully, swaggering out of the shanty of the <i>Minnie
M. Baxter</i>, rubbed his large hands in gleeful anticipation
of the next victim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis up to the Riverview Yacht Club we&rsquo;ll be
goin&rsquo; this mornin&rsquo;, kid,&rdquo; he said confidently.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve worked aroun&rsquo; to it agin. Me pal, the
boat tender what tipped me off on Crosley&rsquo;s <i>Minnehaha</i>,
ain&rsquo;t there no more, but the new guy was aisy
pickin&rsquo;. He fell for a little split, without battin&rsquo;
an eye, so he did, and sent word down last night
that a little fishin&rsquo; party headed for Snug Island
would push off at dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snug Island, huh?&rdquo; Skippy asked fearfully.
&ldquo;That means Watson&rsquo;s Channel for us again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; laughed Tully, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a spot I like. Nobody
goes through Watson&rsquo;s Channel &rsquo;cept they&rsquo;re
headed for Snug Island. And nobody goes to Snug
Island fishin&rsquo; but a coupla rich guys what own the
whole place. It&rsquo;s aisy pickin&rsquo; so &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you it&rsquo;s easy, Big Joe,&rdquo; said Skippy, &ldquo;but
not for me. Sometimes I think I never had anythin&rsquo;
so hard to do in my life as just gettin&rsquo; up nerve
to go on these trips. Gee, I ain&rsquo;t never had the
heart to tell Pop about them&mdash;I lied, an&rsquo; said we
was makin&rsquo; a pretty good livin&rsquo; towin&rsquo; an&rsquo; fishin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Joe roared with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and we&rsquo;re towin&rsquo; and fishin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said with
a malicious wink. &ldquo;Ye didn&rsquo;t tell Toby no lie. We
fish the money out o&rsquo; &rsquo;em and thin tow thim back&mdash;that&rsquo;s
no story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t laugh about it, Big Joe,&rdquo;
Skippy said with a frown. &ldquo;It makes it seem as if
it was a joke&mdash;as if you liked it almost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d be likin&rsquo; it too, kid, if ye wanted to
get back at these rich guys much as I do. But I
won&rsquo;t be laughin&rsquo; about it no more, if it makes ye
feel that way. Sufferin&rsquo; swordfish but ye don&rsquo;t have
to be actin&rsquo; like we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to a funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel funny about goin&rsquo; to the Riverview Yacht
Club this morning. Big Joe, would you stay away
from there if I asked you to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any mornin&rsquo; but this one, Skippy me boy,&rdquo; said
Tully with all his old affection. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be side-steppin&rsquo;
it on account o&rsquo; this new boat tender. He&rsquo;s
expectin&rsquo; a little handout so I can&rsquo;t be disappointin&rsquo;
him. But I&rsquo;ll tell ye what, kid, if it&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; ye
feel so awful bad I&rsquo;ll chuck this game &rsquo;fore ye can
say any more. I&rsquo;ll be thinkin&rsquo; up somethin&rsquo; else.
Anythin&rsquo; but seem&rsquo; ye&rsquo; feelin&rsquo; sad, kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They got into the kicker and chugged out of the
inlet once more. Skippy&rsquo;s eyes glistened happily
and he told himself that he could forget the ominous
whisperings inside of him for just this once.
Indeed, he could forget everything distasteful in the
past few weeks now that Tully had promised to
give up the hated business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t heard from Crosley or Skinner since
that mornin&rsquo; we towed &rsquo;em back, huh Big Joe?&rdquo; he
asked irrelevantly. &ldquo;I wonder if they found out
what was really wrong with the engine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d o&rsquo; heard &rsquo;bout it soon enough if they did,
so we would,&rdquo; said Tully thoughtfully. &ldquo;Anyways,
I heard that Crosley sold the <i>Minnehaha</i> right that
next day. He said he didn&rsquo;t want no boat that almost
put him down in Watson&rsquo;s Channel. Ha, ha!
Sure and I&rsquo;m glad he did. He should be worryin&rsquo;
with his money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more they pulled up beside the slip of the
Riverview Yacht Club and once more Big Joe stole
silently up the lawn in the gray morning shadows.
Skippy waited patiently, albeit anxiously, and held
the boat secure while his weary eyes blinked sleepily
in the sultry air.</p>
<p>After a time, Big Joe came hurrying out of the
shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple as sayin&rsquo; meow, kid,&rdquo; he said exultantly.
&ldquo;The boat tender tells me this guy&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; alone to
Snug Island this mornin&rsquo;. He couldn&rsquo;t be rememberin&rsquo;
the guy&rsquo;s name what owns her, but he says
the boat ain&rsquo;t a week old. She&rsquo;s a peach&mdash;a trim,
twenty-six footer, kid! And of all names she&rsquo;s
got! Sufferin&rsquo; swordfish!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Davy Jones</i>&mdash;so &rsquo;tis. Can ye be beatin&rsquo;
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Big Joe!</i>&rdquo; Skippy said in a small, frightened
voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a name that scares me terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ye&rsquo;re crazy, kid, ye&rsquo;re crazy!</i> Sure and what&rsquo;s
in a name. Just &rsquo;cause Davy Jones happens to
mean....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same I&rsquo;m scared terrible,&rdquo; Skippy maintained
stoutly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s lots in names whether
you believe it or not. Now take the <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i>&mdash;nothin&rsquo; bad could come of her in the end,
I bet, and if it did I bet it would be for the best, because
it was my mother&rsquo;s name. Even if there&rsquo;s
been trouble about the barge from the beginnin&rsquo;
there&rsquo;s good come on it too. When Pop was taken
away, then you came to be good to me so that shows
there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; good about the barge, don&rsquo;t it?
But Davy Jones only means one thing, Big Joe, an&rsquo;
you can say, what&rsquo;s in a name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What, indeed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">THE ROCKS</span></h2>
<p>It was a murky dawn and no sun followed in its
wake. The air was heavy and oppressive, and low
rumblings of thunder echoed in from sea. Skippy
shook his head worriedly as they chugged out of
sight of the bay to let the <i>Davy Jones</i> pass by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel right this morning, Big Joe,&rdquo; the
boy insisted. &ldquo;Say what you like, but we shouldn&rsquo;t
wait&mdash;we oughta tail the <i>Davy Jones</i>, right away&mdash;<i>this
minute</i>, before the storm comes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ye be worryin&rsquo; agin, hey?&rdquo; Tully asked
impatiently. &ldquo;That storm&rsquo;s out at sea and it won&rsquo;t
hit the Channel. Sure &rsquo;tis just a murky mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Skippy, &ldquo;but I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully was beginning to be annoyed with Skippy&rsquo;s
gloomy predictions and he showed it. Yet somehow
it gave him a little uneasiness and from time
to time he glanced thoughtfully from the boy to the
distant black horizon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The storm clouds were coming nearer and thunder
rolled ominously over their heads. Finally
Tully turned over his motor and set her nose about.
After she had warmed up, he opened wide the throttle
and headed for the bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be keepin&rsquo; her open and beat it for the Channel
soon&rsquo;s we get across,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be
gettin&rsquo; there sure &rsquo;fore the storm breaks bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Skippy, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s travelin&rsquo;
in from sea, fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; round by The Rocks and save
fifteen minutes or so,&rdquo; Tully said hopefully searching
the boy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis high enough tide for to
take a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rocks, that bane of all mariners who were
unfamiliar with the lurking waters beyond the bay,
could be safely passed in small boats at high tide.
There were few, however, who took advantage of
this concession of Nature to the small nautical man,
nearly all mariners preferring the greater safety
that was offered them by going the long way around
Inland Beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>A high wind was steadily rising as they chugged
into the vicinity of The Rocks, and it prevented
Skippy from hearing that call of distress for which
he was so intently listening. Whether the wind
was against them, he did not know, for the howling
tempest and turbulent water drowned out all other
sounds.</p>
<p>The storm broke after a few minutes and rain
lashed at them from all sides. Tully said not a
word, but stayed at his wheel silent and grave. And
by his averted head, Skippy knew that he, too, was
listening for that siren call from the <i>Davy Jones</i>.</p>
<p>Salt spray flung itself up over the bow and into
Skippy&rsquo;s face. He could have moved farther back
to avoid it, but he seemed incapable of action then,
and sat tense and white, listening, listening....</p>
<p>Tully did not miss it. The boy&rsquo;s tragic expression
so dismayed him that he felt for the first time
in his life that he should have mended his ways
while there was still time. All his sins seemed to
have crowded into Skippy&rsquo;s face to accuse him.</p>
<p>And still they heard no call of distress from the
<i>Davy Jones</i>.</p>
<p>Tully, desperate, raced his engine until they whistled
through the foaming spray. Then suddenly
they felt the keel grind under them with such force
that it took all their combined strength to steady the
boat and keep her from turning over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened, do you s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo; Skippy asked
with white face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sufferin&rsquo; swordfish, kid!&rdquo; Tully cried. &ldquo;I think
she&rsquo;s stove in&mdash;The Rocks! <i>Look!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed and Skippy looked, to see a jagged
hole in the bottom of the kicker. Water came in
through it rapidly and even as he stared at it, it
trickled over his feet and up to his ankles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">SUSPENSE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo; Skippy cried. &ldquo;Gee, what&rsquo;ll
we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be swimmin&rsquo; for it, kid,&rdquo; Big Joe answered,
his face ashen and drawn. &ldquo;Inland
Beach&rsquo;s nearest&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be swimmin&rsquo; it in a half
hour, takin&rsquo; it aisy like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Easy!</i> In this water and wind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skippy, don&rsquo;t be worryin&rsquo;. Sure and I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
to see ye go down. I&rsquo;ll be keepin&rsquo; ye up if it
takes me life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Skippy turned, pleading. Big Joe
knew and his eyes dropped before the boy&rsquo;s accusing
gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what can I be doin&rsquo; about the <i>Davy Jones</i>
now, kid!&rdquo; he protested &ldquo;I <i>got</i> ye to be thinkin&rsquo;
about now.... Sufferin&rsquo; swordfish!&rdquo; He groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we gotta swim to Inland Beach as fast as
we can, Big Joe,&rdquo; Skippy said, master of himself
once more. &ldquo;We gotta get help right away for the
<i>Davy Jones</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure,&rdquo; the big fellow moaned, &ldquo;anythin&rsquo;,
kid, only don&rsquo;t be lookin&rsquo; at me so accusin&rsquo;. Did I
know it was goin&rsquo; to happen like this? Sufferin&rsquo;
swordfish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, Big Joe&mdash;<i>c&rsquo;mon</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had no sooner jumped clear of the boat
than she sank out of sight. A terrific gale blew
them along and Skippy kept close to Tully, buoyed
up by the thought that he must keep going in order
to get help for the <i>Davy Jones</i>.</p>
<p>And for once Tully was right in a prediction. It
took them all of the half hour before they sighted
the sandy wastes of Inland Beach.</p>
<p>The summer colonists sheltered from the storm
in their inadequately built bungalows sighted the
bobbing heads of the swimmers as they battled their
way against the tide. Speedily the beach was covered
with people and the life-guards, summarily
dragged from their bunks in their beach shanty,
jumped drowsy-eyed into the life-boat and went into
action.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the two were rushed up to the
guards&rsquo; shanty and hurriedly divested of their dripping
garments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;We gotta ...&rdquo; Skippy began as soon as he had
a chance to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we heard a siren,&rdquo; Big Joe interposed.
&ldquo;Sure, it sounded like distress&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t
a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heard it plain!&rdquo; Skippy exclaimed anxiously.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; it came from the Channel&mdash;didn&rsquo;t it, Big Joe,
huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and he&rsquo;s right. &rsquo;Tis about where I figgered
she was comin&rsquo; from,&rdquo; Tully added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; we better start right out again!&rdquo; Skippy
said eagerly. &ldquo;With this high wind....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A guy hasn&rsquo;t much chance in the Channel,&rdquo; interposed
one of the guards bluntly. &ldquo;I can tell you
that before we start. And if it wasn&rsquo;t that you say
you&rsquo;re sure you heard it, we wouldn&rsquo;t take a chance
ourselves. Even a big tub like ours ain&rsquo;t a match
for the Channel in a storm and high wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re sure we heard it! Ain&rsquo;t we, Big
Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we did that!&rdquo; Tully said emphatically.</p>
<p>And so they started for the Channel.</p>
<p>The wind died down shortly after they had lost
sight of Inland Beach. Presently the rain ceased
and after a few moments&rsquo; struggle with storm
clouds, the sun came smiling through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Skippy smiled too, hopeful that it augured well
for the object of their search. Tully relaxed and
took a cigarette that one of the guards offered him.
He talked little and kept his eyes ahead.</p>
<p>They reached the Channel in a half hour and for
a full hour they searched it up and down. Skippy
kept his eyes on the water; he dared not let the
guards see the hopelessness written there should his
glance chance to meet Tully&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> be dreamin&rsquo; we heard a siren,
now could we?&rdquo; Tully pleaded when the guards announced
their intention of returning to the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys didn&rsquo;t seem to be so sure you heard
any at all when we first got you out of the water,&rdquo;
one of the men reminded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure and we were kind o&rsquo; all in from the breaks
we got,&rdquo; Tully explained. His voice sounded hollow
and weary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t hear no siren now,&rdquo; said the other
guard, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve been up and down the Channel.
If there <i>was</i> any guy in distress, maybe he&rsquo;s been
swept out to sea. And we can&rsquo;t go hunting that far
for you fellers. We&rsquo;ll send out word to the coast
guard anyway when we get back just to be on the
safe side. They&rsquo;ll find the tub if it&rsquo;s still afloat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if there was any siren signaling distress
when that high wind first come up,&rdquo; said the first
guard, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s most likely screeching now for to get
into Davy Jones&rsquo; locker. Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy and Big Joe would have given their lives
at that moment to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE DUFFYS</span></h2>
<p>They borrowed a kicker from one of the summer
colonists and set out for home just before noon.
Skippy was too overwhelmed to speak until long
after they left the beach and Tully sat tragic and
silent at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might&rsquo;s well look agin,&rdquo; he murmured brokenly,
as he headed the boat toward the Channel.
&ldquo;Just so&rsquo;s to be makin&rsquo; sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; Skippy echoed. Then: &ldquo;Gee, do
you think maybe he was blowin&rsquo; the siren?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he must o&rsquo; done. He must o&rsquo; been blowin&rsquo;
it like mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spent half the afternoon chugging up and
down the Channel and passed several craft, government
and otherwise, which had heard the warning
that the Inland Beach guards had passed along.
Finally they decided to return home and with bowed
heads found their way out of the treacherous waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure if the coast guards ain&rsquo;t found him, we
won&rsquo;t&mdash;not if we be stayin&rsquo; there all night,&rdquo; said
Tully mournfully. &ldquo;Kid, don&rsquo;t ye be jumpin&rsquo; on
me, now. If ye knew what I been through since
... since.... I been blowin&rsquo; a siren in distress
five hun&rsquo;erd times, so I have, and five hun&rsquo;erd times,
I been in that <i>Davy Jones</i> callin&rsquo; me lungs out for
help an&rsquo; no help come! I&rsquo;ve sunk with her too&mdash;oh
shiverin&rsquo; swordfish ... kid, I ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but a
plain....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, Big Joe,&rdquo; said Skippy, moved to
the depths of his soul with pity. &ldquo;Gee, don&rsquo;t I
know! You wouldn&rsquo;t have done it a-purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. &rsquo;Tis right ye be there.&rdquo; Tully looked
beaten.</p>
<p>They chugged on up the river and seemed to pass
everyone they knew. Inspector Jones and his men
bobbed by in the trim harbor launch waving a cheery
greeting to Skippy and eyeing Tully with obvious
suspicion.</p>
<p>Skippy was grateful for the silent inlet and the
warm throaty bark that Mugs gave as he scrambled
aboard the barge. He looked at the dog, winced
a little at his faithful canine eyes and took him up
in his arms. He couldn&rsquo;t do to Mugs what they
had done to that unknown man on the <i>Davy Jones</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>He sprawled in a rickety arm chair on deck while
the sun sank slowly in the west. The whole horizon
was a blaze of scarlet, then gold, then purple
and at last it faded into leaden colored clouds. Big
Joe was calling him in to supper.</p>
<p>Skippy looked down in the crook of his arm at the
sleeping dog. Supper? He didn&rsquo;t want any&mdash;he
never wanted to eat while that man on the <i>Davy
Jones</i> lay in Watson&rsquo;s Channel. He couldn&rsquo;t do it
to Mugs.</p>
<p>Tully got tired of waiting and came out on deck.
After one glance at Skippy&rsquo;s tragic face he got his
hat, pulled it down over his head and left the barge
while the boy watched him go with a constricted
feeling in his throat. And though he wanted with
all his heart to call Big Joe back, he knew that he
could never again sit opposite him at the table with
a dead man between them.</p>
<p>Dusk settled over the inlet and through the
shadows came Mrs. Duffy. Her cheery smile was
conspicuous by its absence just then and her cheeks
looked tear-stained and haggard. Skippy forgot
the dead man in the <i>Davy Jones</i>&mdash;he was all concern
for this kindly neighbor who had helped nurse
him back to health.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Hadn&rsquo;t Skippy heard? Mrs. Duffy sobbed a little,
then bravely smiled through her tears. She had
to be strong and brave&mdash;other wives and mothers
in the Basin were getting used to the experience of
seeing their menfolk taken in by the long arm of the
law. And now Mr. Duffy had been added to that
number.</p>
<p>What had he done? No more than other river
folk had done before him. But it was forbidden by
the law and there you were. And the excuse that
they had to live and eat carried no weight in the
courts of the land. Neither did the courts care
that a rich and unscrupulous Josiah Flint had lured
these men into his vicious employ at starvation
wages only to leave them unwanted and ostracized
from honest employment upon his untimely death.
And Mr. Josephus Duffy, obeying that primal law
of the survival of the fittest, was to be jailed for five
years because he stole when employment was denied
him. Five years of punishment for bringing food
home to his family!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Skippy&rsquo;s young heart was bursting with sympathy.
Wrapped up in his own and his father&rsquo;s concerns he
had been vaguely conscious of his neighbors, the
Duffys of the <i>Dinky O. Cross</i>. Squatters like himself,
he had been aware that they came and went,
but that was all. Now they became suddenly real
and vivid to him&mdash;the Duffys, father and mother,
and their two children, minus the father now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t Skinner give him nothin&rsquo; at the
Central havin&rsquo; two kids like you got?&rdquo; he asked
sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skinner&rsquo;d push men in prison before he&rsquo;d help
&rsquo;em get a decent job,&rdquo; the good woman said with a
jerk of her head. &ldquo;He said he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to clean all
us scum out of this Basin&mdash;ain&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Skippy had heard only too well. He leaned
over and timidly touched the woman&rsquo;s work-worn
hands, pledging his slim, manly self as an aid and
comfort to herself and her two unfortunate children.
In gratitude, she hugged the boy to her
breast and hurried back to the <i>Dinky O. Cross</i> to
put her young ones to bed.</p>
<p>Skippy cherished that embrace; it was the only
maternal affection he had ever known. His eyes
shone into the darkness with the joy of it and he
hugged Mugs still closer in his arms and spent some
time in reflecting on why he was so happy when he
was so sad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Josiah Flint and Marty Skinner rose up before his
eyes. He was beginning to realize what sorrow
they had brought to the river people&mdash;<i>his people</i>!
A fellow feels things like that when he&rsquo;s going on
thirteen.</p>
<p>Thirteen! Skippy looked up into the starlit sky
and blinked. Mugs&rsquo; even breathing was like the
whisper of the breeze blowing about his head. And
he went to sleep planning how he could save the menfolk
of the Basin from future prison life. He
would see that the boys went to school as he himself
had wanted to do so badly and he would see
that they got decent, honest wages so that they could
live as other people did in houses with pretty gardens....</p>
<p>Tully found him still asleep when he came back
at midnight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">GOOD NEWS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Skip&mdash;Skippy, kid!&rdquo; Tully called, shaking the
boy to arouse him.</p>
<p>Skippy sat up, startled. Mugs barked blatantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, huh? You look as if something&rsquo;d
happened&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully motioned him into the shanty where he
lighted the lamp and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can ye stand hearin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; without faintin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
he asked mirthlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; the boy answered shaking his
straight hair from off his forehead. &ldquo;But I hope it
ain&rsquo;t anything worse!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better and worse, sorta,&rdquo; Big Joe laughed ruefully.
&ldquo;But first so&rsquo;s to be aisin&rsquo; ye, kid&mdash;the <i>Davy
Jones</i> turned back, so she did, when she reached the
bay this mornin&rsquo;. From what the boat tender told
me, sure must o&rsquo; put a little extra dose o&rsquo; the powder
in the breather and she started kickin&rsquo; up a rumpus
a little sooner than ordinary, she did. So the
owner, bein&rsquo; a foxy guy, turned back when he heard
that and saw the storm clouds comin&rsquo; in from over
the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the <i>Davy Jones</i> ain&rsquo;t in her locker then, huh?
Gee, am I glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and she got back to the club, and the owner
had somebody come right away to be seein&rsquo; what was
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they did, kid. He&rsquo;s got the police on the
case, and I think they&rsquo;ll be workin&rsquo; on me. But they
ain&rsquo;t got no evidence so they ain&rsquo;t, and besides, I
took all me powder and threw it in the inlet tonight,
so I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy sat down at the table, his head in his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I was afraid something awful would come
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t ye be worryin&rsquo; too soon, kid.
They&rsquo;ll have to be goin&rsquo; some to get me.... You
can bet on that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, Big Joe, you don&rsquo;t savvy. It&rsquo;s the idea of
gettin&rsquo; the coppers suspectin&rsquo; me and sayin&rsquo; they expected
sumpin&rsquo; like that from Toby Dare&rsquo;s kid.
That&rsquo;s what I couldn&rsquo;t bear Pop to hear after he&rsquo;s
planned better things for me. Gee, I couldn&rsquo;t
stand it!&rdquo; Then: &ldquo;Who owns the <i>Davy Jones</i>, Big
Joe, huh?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s a funny thing,&rdquo; Tully said. &ldquo;The
<i>Davy Jones</i> is Crosley&rsquo;s. He bought her a week
ago after he sold the <i>Minnehaha</i>. I s&rsquo;pose that&rsquo;s
why he played foxy whin the ingine wint wrong with
the new one? If that big sap boat tender had only
tole me who owned her I&rsquo;d niver....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz, Big Joe, now I can see why Pop said
these crooked rackets don&rsquo;t pay in the end. It&rsquo;s account
of that <i>if</i>. It&rsquo;s always if this or that didn&rsquo;t
happen everythin&rsquo; would be all right. But it never
is. Oh, gee, I&rsquo;m not hoppin&rsquo; on you&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;d
been just like you if it wasn&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;m sick and disgusted
with crooked rackets already. Maybe it&rsquo;s
because my mother came from a farm and so I&rsquo;m
not all river, huh? Anyway, I know I don&rsquo;t want
any more of this business. I&rsquo;m gonna be straight
I am. I learned a lesson today on that <i>Davy Jones</i>
business an&rsquo; I mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too!&rdquo; said Big Joe with all his old time
swagger. &ldquo;I was tellin&rsquo; meself comin&rsquo; back here
that if I think up an aisy racket where the coppers
don&rsquo;t get wise, I&rsquo;ll be savin&rsquo; up a few grand an&rsquo;
thin open up one o&rsquo; thim hot dog stands in the country.
Sure and the river won&rsquo;t see me at all, at all
after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy laughed outright&mdash;for, boy that he was,
he could see that Tully would be Tully as long as
the river flowed down to the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">BEASELL</span></h2>
<p>Next day, life in the Basin flowed once more in
familiar channels. Tully trod the decks watching
for the unwelcome police and puffing furiously on
his cigarettes. Skippy sprawled in the rickety easy
chair, playing with the dog and calling out to Mrs.
Duffy some words of cheer when the occasion required.
And when sunset came and the law had
not put in its appearance they had supper noisily together.</p>
<p>Tully stretched out in his bunk after the meal
had been cleared away. He looked at peace with
the world. Skippy, watching him out of the corner
of his eye, wondered what new racket he was
planning now. And he didn&rsquo;t rest until he had
asked the big fellow point blank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me racket for a while, kid,&rdquo; Tully said amiably,
&ldquo;is to be keepin&rsquo; ye from gettin&rsquo; gloomy and sad.
Whin I&rsquo;m sure that Crosley ain&rsquo;t set the coppers on
me trail thin I&rsquo;ll be turnin&rsquo; around&mdash;see? Right
now I&rsquo;m stickin&rsquo; close to the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>, so
I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you could do worse, Big Joe, believe me.
I&rsquo;m gonna stick close too until I know what&rsquo;s what.
But we&rsquo;ll talk about that then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An insistent knock sounded on the door. Tully
blanched and looked about for some means of
escape. But Skippy, braving himself to the task,
swung open the door to get it over with.</p>
<p>A man stood outside, bowing graciously and smiling.
He stepped inside at Skippy&rsquo;s invitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beasell&rsquo;s the name, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yuh
heard how Marty Skinner&rsquo;s runnin&rsquo; the works for
Buck Flint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we been hearin&rsquo; it too much, I&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo;
ye,&rdquo; Big Joe snapped as he came ponderously out of
his bunk and stood on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all jake then, big boy, you an&rsquo; me won&rsquo;t
waste no time,&rdquo; Beasell said unruffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to tell us....&rdquo; Skippy began fearfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Marty says all yuh squatters in this Basin&rsquo;ll have
tuh scram by sundown tomorrow, get me? He&rsquo;s
had all the rough stuff he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; for and that goes
double for the warehouse guys. So it&rsquo;s scram in
twenty-four hours, see? If yuh can&rsquo;t take these
lousy scows out we&rsquo;ll blow &rsquo;em up, get me? Just a
nice little Fourth uh July party, see?&rdquo; He chuckled
as if at a great joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blow up the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>!&rdquo;
Skippy cried. &ldquo;Even a guy like Skinner can&rsquo;t take
her from me &rsquo;cause, &rsquo;cause....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lissen, punk, and you too, big boy, it&rsquo;s scram by
sundown tomorrow,&rdquo; Beasell snarled. &ldquo;Yuh better
get me. I ain&rsquo;t kiddin&rsquo; believe yuh me!&rdquo; He
scowled as he left to spread the bad news to the
<i>Dinky O. Cross</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sufferin&rsquo; swordfish! Sure that Skinner&rsquo;s a lousy
rat,&rdquo; Big Joe growled. &ldquo;I should o&rsquo; been pastin&rsquo;
that slimy Beasell but it wouldn&rsquo;t done no good.
He&rsquo;s only carryin&rsquo; out orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only me&rsquo;n you&rsquo;s gotta go, Big Joe,&rdquo; said
Skippy plaintively, &ldquo;but Mrs. Duffy an&rsquo; her kids an&rsquo;
everybody here in the Basin. How&rsquo;re they all
gonna pack up an&rsquo; clear out by tomorrow night,
huh? Gee, that ain&rsquo;t fair. There ain&rsquo;t one of us
got a home to go to&mdash;gee whiz, these barges, why&mdash;they&rsquo;re
home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully&rsquo;s face looked distorted as he walked to and
fro across the shanty floor. Finally he turned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure Skinner don&rsquo;t know what it means to be
sendin&rsquo; that Beasell guy down here to be tellin&rsquo; us
we must be out by tomorrow night, bad cess to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean, Big Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, folks here ain&rsquo;t like other folks, like ye&rsquo;ve
noticed. They been free for years and they ain&rsquo;t
goin&rsquo; to be kicked out without doin&rsquo; some kickin&rsquo;
first thimselves. Law? Sure, they don&rsquo;t know
what it&rsquo;s all about so what do they care, I&rsquo;ll be askin&rsquo;
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Joe Tully had summed it all up in one sentence.
They didn&rsquo;t know about the law, so what
did they care about it?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t many hours before Skippy learned how
little they did care.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<h2 id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI
<br /><span class="small">MOONLIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Skippy waited until Tully was fast asleep that
night, then he crept stealthily out of the shanty with
the dog skipping and sniffing at his heels. He was
careful to close the door softly behind him; he
wanted to be alone.</p>
<p>It was a different Skippy that trod those decks,
a new and older Skippy, who looked about the lumbering
old barge through his father&rsquo;s eyes. It did
not seem possible to him that Skinner could so ruthlessly
order him away from the only home he had.
Yet he realized that not many hours hence he would
not even have <i>that</i> home.</p>
<p>He went forward and, getting to his knees, leaned
far over and stared down at the trickling waters of
the muddy inlet lapping against the hull. The dog,
thinking him to be playing, jumped about with a soft
whine to draw his master&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Skippy tumbled him about for a while, then
climbed down with him into the borrowed kicker
that was anchored alongside the barge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna take one last cruise out and back
in the inlet again&mdash;see, Mugs? I&rsquo;ve just gotta see
how the <i>Minnie M. Baxter&rsquo;s</i> gonna look when I
think of her afterwards. I don&rsquo;t want to forget it&rsquo;s
where I lived with two of the best pals I&rsquo;ll ever have,
outside of Pop. Gee, Mugs, maybe it&rsquo;s silly to feel
so over a barge,&rdquo; he confided to the attentive
puppy, &ldquo;but I gotta feel that it&rsquo;s sumpin&rsquo; I must
think a lot of. Every time I&rsquo;ve visited Pop, he&rsquo;s
asked me how was the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>. Just
like as if she was a human being, he asked about
her! So I love her on accounta my Pop. He&rsquo;s
proud of her because she was so hard to get and because
he decided to quit Ol&rsquo; Flint and be honest so&rsquo;s
I&rsquo;d have a better chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started the kicker after this long confidence
and steered it with one hand, putting his free arm
about the dog. And as if cherishing the whispered
confidences and affection, the animal cuddled close
and remained perfectly still while the boat crept out
to the mouth of the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>As they turned back, a full moon broke through
some dark clouds and shone brilliantly down upon
the Basin. Skippy looked at the mellow, silver light
gleaming over the grouped barges and he gazed in
wonder at the fairyland that the moon made of the
sordid colony. The dust at once became a shimmering
film of silver and the washlines strung from
shanty to forward deck contained fluttering bits of
laundry that stirred flippantly in the soft night
breeze.</p>
<p>Skippy&rsquo;s heartstrings tightened at the sight of it&mdash;he
loved it all. His honest nature cried out
against the injustice of turning all these people out
of their homes. For that is just what it amounted
to&mdash;no more and no less. Skinner knew that there
wasn&rsquo;t a man in the Basin who could afford to have
his barge lifted out of the mud. They would have
to face it, he realized&mdash;they were people condemned!</p>
<p>He steered the boat farther on until he caught
sight of the moonlight gleaming across his own
shanty. Its shimmering rays picked out in bold relief
the now dulled letters, <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i>, and
he thought of a late afternoon when he and his
father had looked on those same letters so new and
shining, shining in the last brilliant rays of a dying
sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>He turned away from these reflections with heavy
heart only to have his attention drawn to a boat,
floating about the bow of the kicker. As he leaned
forward to see it better, the dog growled ominously.</p>
<p>Skippy drew back instantly, gasping with horror.
He sat stark still for a moment, as cold as ice and
unable to take his eyes away from the battered face
and body of a man he had seen in robust health but
a few hours before.</p>
<p>That man was Beasell, Marty Skinner&rsquo;s lieutenant,
and he appeared lifeless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<h2 id="c32">CHAPTER XXXII
<br /><span class="small">THE LAST OF THE BASIN</span></h2>
<p>Skippy was so frightened that he did nothing for
a moment but sit and stare. Then suddenly he realized
the terrible thing before his eyes, and he pulled
the boat up alongside of the barge, trembling from
head to foot.</p>
<p>The dog leaped out of his arms the moment he
got on deck and refused to run with him to the
shanty. But Skippy had neither the time nor the
nerves to think of anything but the battered Beasell
in the boat floating beside the barge.</p>
<p>He flung open the door of the shanty and rushed
to Tully&rsquo;s bunk. The big fellow jumped up
startled, and sat motionless while Skippy whispered
of his discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it go bad for everybody here?&rdquo; he asked
with agonized suspense. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it, Big Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure &rsquo;twill be just too bad, so &rsquo;twill,&rdquo; Tully said
getting up and dressing. &ldquo;Somewan did it what&rsquo;s
gone cuckoo for thinkin&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll be turned out o&rsquo;
their home tomorrow night. And crazy like, they
beat up that Beasell thinkin&rsquo; they&rsquo;d be gettin&rsquo; even
with Marty Skinner&mdash;see? Sure I know me
Brown&rsquo;s Basin, kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy shivered with the horror of it. If Brown&rsquo;s
Basin was like that, he wouldn&rsquo;t be sorry to leave it
after all. Neither could he love people who used
such ghastly means for their revenge against Skinner.
He wanted to get away from it then, that
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We gotta tell the police, Big Joe, huh?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Big Joe nodded as if he were dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us river people ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to have no peace
whilst Skinner&rsquo;s alive, kid!&rdquo; he said in hard, even
tones. &ldquo;Whoever slugged that Beasell guy&mdash;well,
<i>me</i>, I&rsquo;d be goin&rsquo; for Skinner, so I would. So he&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; to take the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> from ye, is he?
Well, we&rsquo;ll be seein&rsquo; about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget me for now, Big Joe. What worries me
is, what&rsquo;re we gonna do with Beasell? Maybe he&rsquo;s
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ye be goin&rsquo; down and stay till I come, kid,&rdquo;
said the big fellow, drawing on his shoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Skippy started for the kicker. He went forward
but that was as far as he got for he became suddenly
aware of a low, ominous rumbling noise that
seemed to come from shore and run through the
barge colony. Before he had a chance to determine
what it was he felt himself lifted off his feet
bodily and like a feather he was thrown into the
muddy waters of the Basin.</p>
<p>There was a terrific detonation throughout
Brown&rsquo;s Basin as Skippy came to the surface. Fire
leaped from one barge to the other in the twinkling
of an eye and the screams of men, women and children
filled the turbid air.</p>
<p>Smoke poured skyward in great columns and in
the light of the moon, Skippy saw the ponderous
form of Big Joe Tully standing on the deck of the
<i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> shouting and waving his hands.
Suddenly he leaped into the kicker and the boy
called out but he seemed not to hear in the din about
them.</p>
<p>At that moment, the <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> burst into
flames. Big Joe Tully shouted deafeningly and
Skippy, swimming hard to reach him, saw a strange,
almost maniacal expression on his large face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Marty Skinner what&rsquo;s done this!&rdquo; he was
shouting to no one in particular. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis him what&rsquo;s
blowed this place up and took the kid away from
me. &rsquo;Tis him! Skippy&rsquo;s dead&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s
dead! I can&rsquo;t find him!&rdquo; he was almost whimpering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; Skippy called frantically. &ldquo;Big
Joe....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tully was even then steering the kicker out
of the inlet. He had the throttle wide open and
Skippy had no more than a glimpse of the racing
craft before she slipped beyond his sight.</p>
<p>Logs, huge chunks of driftwood and every known
article of household furniture, both broken and
whole, floated in Skippy&rsquo;s path, blocking his progress.
Suddenly he saw a little boat bearing down
upon him, floating through the inlet unoccupied.</p>
<p>He reached out, grabbed the bow and climbed in,
breathless and exhausted. Other kickers were shoving
off filled with crying women and shouting men.
Skippy looked about over the water, but saw nothing
but a procession of slowly moving debris.</p>
<p>He turned over the motor and she responded with
a fearful jerk. He was moving, in any event, moving
away from the fearful heat that the burning
barges threw out over the water. The moon&rsquo;s
shimmering light now looked sickly and pale in contrast
to the fearful red glare that spread over the
entire sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>The screaming sirens of motor boats soon became
part of the pandemonium and Skippy heard commanding
shouts for the boats to clear out of the inlet
immediately. In the wake of this he heard a
heart-rending shriek from the midst of the barge
inferno which made him feel sick and weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Duffy an&rsquo; her two kids ain&rsquo;t nowheres,&rdquo; a
man&rsquo;s voice shouted above the roar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet Skinner
had that dynamite planted.&rdquo; And as Skippy
attempted to turn the kicker about he was peremptorily
ordered from the approaching police launch
to keep on his way out to the river.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t look back again. The <i>Minnie M.
Baxter</i> was a seething mass behind him&mdash;there was
nothing left. Big Joe was nowhere about&mdash;Skippy
suddenly remembered the big fellow&rsquo;s shouts about
Skinner. It gave him an idea and he nosed the boat
down the river.</p>
<p>Out of this confusion of mind, he thought of the
dog. He remembered then that he hadn&rsquo;t seen the
puppy since he had let him down on the deck after
seeing the battered Beasell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>And what had become of him? Was he dead or
alive? Skippy wiped a grimy hand across his forehead.
He was utterly weary and exhausted by the
ordeal. He could not think of an answer to anything.
His world had toppled over since the discovery
of Beasell and the explosion. And now
Mugs was gone too&mdash;his skipping, faithful-eyed pal!
Was there nothing left for him at all?</p>
<p>He put his hands over the wheel and gripped it
bitterly, but soon he relaxed and with a soft sob
he covered his face. And nobody knew but the
river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<h2 id="c33">CHAPTER XXXIII
<br /><span class="small">SKIPPY&rsquo;S WISDOM</span></h2>
<p>Skippy got the most out of his commandeered
kicker. He opened it wide and raced her down the
river and the closer he got to the bay the more apprehensive
did he feel about Big Joe&rsquo;s flight. He
tried not to attach any special significance to his
good friend&rsquo;s shouts, but he could not help remembering
Tully&rsquo;s earlier veiled threats about Skinner.</p>
<p>His fears grew as he chugged out into the bay and
something urged him on still faster. Then he spied
the glistening hull of the beautiful <i>Apollyon</i>, her anchor
lights gleaming like stars against the night and
a single light amidships.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>Funny, the boy thought, how much it seemed like
that night when he and his father had come for the
showdown with the older Flint. Now there was to
be no showdown, but he must warn Skinner against
Big Joe&rsquo;s sudden maniacal fury. Queer that he
should go to such trouble for a man who had given
them no quarter in anything. But he was not thinking
of doing Skinner a good turn beyond that it
might prevent Big Joe from killing the Flint agent
and being sent to jail.</p>
<p>He approached the yacht with his old feeling of
awe. The deck was almost dark as he scrambled
aboard but up forward he saw the rotund form of
the second mate asleep and snoring in a luxurious
swing. The boy could not help remember a very
solemn resolve that night long ago, when the mate
had sworn to be more faithful to his duties during
his night watches.</p>
<p>With silent tread, he hurried along the deck and
stopped before the lighted cabin amidships. Once,
twice, he knocked softly, and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; Marty Skinner&rsquo;s cold voice commanded.</p>
<p>Skippy stepped in, his heart bounding. He was
thinking of the last time he had been in this room
and closed the door, determined he would not be
driven out again until he had had his say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Skinner snapped but this time he did not
order Skippy out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seen Big Joe Tully?&rdquo; Skippy asked bravely.
&ldquo;He been here yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean&mdash;yet? I have no business with
Tully and I haven&rsquo;t any with you that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong both times Mister Skinner. &rsquo;Cause
if you don&rsquo;t listen to me Big Joe&rsquo;ll be comin&rsquo; here
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll try gettin&rsquo; you an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s so mad he&rsquo;ll probably
kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skinner was all interest now. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad and he
may kill me and you come to warn me. That&rsquo;s
funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it ain&rsquo;t funny. I wouldn&rsquo;t care much what
happened to you Mister Skinner you been so hard on
me&rsquo;n Pop an&rsquo; everybody, but I ain&rsquo;t gonna see Big
Joe get in a jam an&rsquo; maybe go to jail for life on accounta
you. I&rsquo;m tippin&rsquo; you off so&rsquo;s Big Joe won&rsquo;t
have no chance gettin&rsquo; jammed. Maybe after that
blowin&rsquo; up of the barges tonight, which they say you
ordered done, an&rsquo; what happened to that guy Beasell
I oughta let....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blowing up barges? Beasell? What d&rsquo;ye
mean, boy? What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Beasell come an&rsquo; ordered us outa the Basin
by sundown tomorrow, sayin&rsquo; it was your orders,
an&rsquo; if we can&rsquo;t get the barges out they&rsquo;ll be blowed
up. Some time after he left me&rsquo;n Joe I go for a
boat ride. When I come back I see Beasell in a
boat all battered an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; as if he&rsquo;s dead. So I
goes to call Joe an&rsquo; while he&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; his shoes on I
comes out again an&rsquo; I just got near the rail when
there&rsquo;s an explosion an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m tossed in the water. I
swim till I find a boat an&rsquo; climb in. I see Big Joe
on deck an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s yellin&rsquo; that I&rsquo;m lost an&rsquo; acts like
he&rsquo;s gonna get you when he jumps in his kicker an&rsquo;
races off without hearin&rsquo; me. So I come right here
to beat him to it an&rsquo; keep him outa trouble, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skinner did not seem interested in the explosion.
While he appeared callous as to the suffering and
death that came in its wake he wanted to know more
about Beasell. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think he&rsquo;s really dead?&rdquo; he
asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looked like that to me,&rdquo; answered Skippy, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
if he wasn&rsquo;t he probably was blowed apart or burnt
up.&rdquo; He wondered at the look of satisfaction that
appeared on Skinner&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;But you better be
beatin&rsquo; it Mister Skinner or Big Joe&rsquo;ll be here an&rsquo;
takin&rsquo; you apart if he don&rsquo;t kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if Big Joe comes here looking for trouble
he&rsquo;ll get it&mdash;and plenty.&rdquo; Skinner reached under
his left arm and pulling out a pistol laid it on the
table before him.</p>
<p>Skippy heard footsteps and turned as if to shout
a warning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet you!&rdquo; Skinner ordered as he picked up the
pistol and leveled it at the door. Skippy with
visions of his beloved Big Joe shot dead in his tracks
as he opened the door wished from the bottom of
his heart that he had not tried to warn Skinner.
All he had done was bait the trap for Big Joe.</p>
<p>He stood there, a bit to the side of the desk, his
knees shaking and, while his brain was active, he was
so terror stricken that he could not open his mouth
to warn Big Joe of his impending fate. He closed
his eyes and said a little prayer as he heard the door
creak a bit on its hinges. Why hadn&rsquo;t he left the
door open when he came into Skinner&rsquo;s cabin,
why....</p>
<p>A few tense seconds that seemed as so many hours
to Skippy and then he heard the voice of Inspector
Jones: &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s hardly the nice way to welcome
a police officer, Mr. Skinner. I like your extended
hand but not with a gun in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skippy looked up to see Inspector Jones advancing
into the room and this time a policeman&rsquo;s uniform
was a most welcome sight to him. He
breathed thanks that the visitor was not Big Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just tuck the hardware away, Inspector, and
give you the hand.&rdquo; Skinner smiled and did so. &ldquo;I
thought you were Big Joe Tully coming in to get me.
The boy here warned me Joe was on the warpath
so I was all set to welcome him and beat him to the
draw.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I could see,&rdquo; the Inspector commented.
&ldquo;Heard about the burning of the barges in the Basin
and what happened to poor Beasell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This boy told me there was an explosion and
that some one slugged Beasell. Tell me is he&mdash;is
he&mdash;dead?&rdquo; The question sounded to Skippy as if
Skinner was hoping the answer would be yes.</p>
<p>Inspector Jones looked sharply at Skinner. &ldquo;Yes.
He is,&rdquo; he answered simply and again looked up
sharply as Skinner sighed as if in relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beasell was in my confidence. He knew my
business and I trusted him,&rdquo; Skinner spoke as if to
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know you did,&rdquo; the Inspector agreed and
there was that in his words which made Skippy feel
as if there was something behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you know that, may I ask, Inspector?&rdquo;
Skinner seemed a bit ill at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talked to him before he died. We picked him
up in a boat when we went to the fire. He had
been badly beaten but before he died he regained
consciousness. He talked plenty, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say? Tell who beat him up?&rdquo;
Skinner was plainly anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, strange to say he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then...?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just this.&rdquo; Inspector Jones whipped out his
gun. &ldquo;Put &rsquo;em up Skinner and keep &rsquo;em up. I&rsquo;m
arresting you and I&rsquo;m going to charge you with the
murder of Josiah Flint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;that&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s ridiculous, Inspector.
You can&rsquo;t make a charge like that stand up on
the ravings of a dying man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you that Beasell made any such
charges. But I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you now that he made a
dying statement that he was in the kicker off the
yacht when Skippy and his father came along, that
he had been there some time, and hearing you and
Flint quarreling, he watched through the porthole,
saw you two struggling after Flint charged you with
cheating him&mdash;saw you shoot the old man in the
back when you twisted him around as he tried to
snatch the gun you drew in your anger. He also
saw you sit old Flint up again, scatter papers all
over the place and take what money there was in his
desk. Beasell&rsquo;s blackmailed you plenty since,
threatening to turn you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that isn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; the Inspector went on relentlessly.
&ldquo;Buck Flint has been giving you a free
hand and staying away, but he&rsquo;s had accountants
working on your books and he&rsquo;s got plenty of evidence
as to how you&rsquo;ve ben cheating him and how
you cheated the old man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;No jury will ever convict me on evidence like
that.&rdquo; Skinner seemed to have regained his composure.
&ldquo;Beasell was only a cheap crook anyway
and he&rsquo;s dead, too. Stealing money isn&rsquo;t murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right on those points,&rdquo; the Inspector
mused and Skinner started to lower his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, not so fast there! Keep &rsquo;em up!
There&rsquo;s one bet you overlooked, Skinner, and I&rsquo;m
going to call it right now.&rdquo; Still keeping Skinner
covered the Inspector moved closer and pulled the
gun out of the man&rsquo;s shoulder holster. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
hunch that our ballistic expert will find a groove in
the barrel of your gun which will prove the bullet
which killed old Flint was fired by you. The gun
never was found, you remember, but the bullet with
a peculiar mark was and it&rsquo;s still right down at headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skinner slumped into a chair at that, but Skippy
looked quickly from his dejected figure as he heard
a familiar bark. He turned to the door and there
in the arms of a policeman was his beloved Mugs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mugs! Mugs!&rdquo; he cried out overjoyed. And
then, as if in afterthought, &ldquo;See anythin&rsquo; of Big Joe,
officer? Gee, if he&rsquo;d only come along now, &rsquo;cause
I know my Pop&rsquo;s gonna be free soon, everythin&rsquo;d
be just grand. Gee, but I&rsquo;m happy. I&rsquo;m....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly frightened at something he
saw in the policeman&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;what&rsquo;s
wrong? Tell me,&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a tough spot, kid, but I know you got
plenty guts, so here goes point blank. Big Joe went
back to your barge figgering you might have found
your way back there. We see him and tell him
you&rsquo;re safe. Then he hears the dog barkin&rsquo;, goes
into the flames after him and saves him.&rdquo; He
paused, gulped, then went on: &ldquo;He was burned bad,
Big Joe was. Fulla smoke, too. Well, anyways
... he kicked off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence, which was finally broken by
Skippy&rsquo;s sobs. At a motion from Inspector Jones
the policeman, who had brought Mugs and the sad
news about Big Joe, handcuffed Skinner and took
him out of the cabin, softly closing the door.</p>
<p>It was far in the night before Inspector Jones had
Skippy sufficiently comforted so that the boy fell
asleep. Then the Inspector bundled him up, carried
him to the police launch and that night Skippy
and Mugs slept at the Inspector&rsquo;s home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<h2 id="c34">CHAPTER XXXIV
<br /><span class="small">THE GREAT ADVENTURE</span></h2>
<p>Skippy had two things to show his delighted
father when they met at the railroad station a few
weeks later, by which time Skinner had confessed
murdering Josiah Flint when mad with rage at having
been caught stealing, and Skippy&rsquo;s grief over
Big Joe&rsquo;s death had become less poignant. One was
the gawky Mugs and the other a little satchel which
he carried under his arm with the greatest care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in there, Skippy son?&rdquo; Toby asked after
their outstretched arms had clung in an awkward
embrace.</p>
<p>Skippy winked at his father mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I waited to tell you now, Pop&mdash;sort of as a surprise.
It&rsquo;s what Buck Flint calls redress money&mdash;money
that Old Flint should have paid you and
didn&rsquo;t. And he says it&rsquo;s for the price of the <i>Minnie
M. Baxter</i> too. Altogether he said he figured
Old Flint owed you a thousand dollars with interest&mdash;see
Pop?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>Toby was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we a-goin&rsquo; ter do with it, son?&rdquo; he wanted
to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you say, Pop. There&rsquo;s enough to buy
another <i>Minnie M. Baxter</i> and more besides, huh?
An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s enough to buy a nice hot dog stand somewheres
up in the mountains where the doctor said I
wouldn&rsquo;t have no more bad throats. So what do
you say, Pop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mountains, Skippy boy,&rdquo; said Toby with shining
eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call our stand the <i>Minnie Baxter</i>
jest the same, hey? &rsquo;Cause didn&rsquo;t she sort uv bring
us luck in the end, after all? How&rsquo;d we got all this
money if she hadn&rsquo;t uv burned up and that helped
ter show up Skinner and made Buck Flint feel sorry
and that he ought ter make good. Yessir we&rsquo;ll call
her that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A train announcer sauntered out of the big iron
gates and in his sonorous voice called out, &ldquo;Mountain
Express on Track Number Four ... Cold
Glen ... Pine Ridge ... Baxter....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did yer hear that, Skippy?&rdquo; asked Toby excitedly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place in them mountains what&rsquo;s
called <i>Baxter</i>! Seems like as if it was Fate or
somethin&rsquo;! S&rsquo;pose we jest try her fer luck. What
do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on, Pop,&rdquo; Skippy cried joyfully. &ldquo;Baxter
for luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And arm in arm, Skippy and Toby, with Mugs
sniffing at their heels, darted through the big iron
gates on their Great Adventure.</p>

<br />AMONG THE RIVER PIRATES</h3>
<p class="center"><i>By</i>
<br />HUGH LLOYD</p>
<p>Nearly all the boats and barges on
the River that was &ldquo;home&rdquo; to
Skippy belonged to old Flint. A
grasping and merciless man, Flint
also controlled the lives of most
of the people who tried to earn
their living on the River. For
many years Skippy&rsquo;s father had
worked for him; loading and unloading
illicit merchandise&mdash;aware
that he was involved in crooked
business but reaping little benefit
beyond a meager living therefrom.</p>
<p>Honest, courageous young Skippy
finally persuades his father to
leave Flint&rsquo;s employ&mdash;but it is impossible
to escape the evil net in
which they are caught. Before
they succeed in getting away from
the illicit river traffic, they become
involved with the police&mdash;the
boy&rsquo;s father is accused of murder&mdash;Skippy
is forced into a crooked
game&mdash;and the Basin, where the
condemned river barges provide
homes for the river people is
blown up. In one great blast men,
women, children and all their
worldly goods are destroyed in a
sea of lapping flames.</p>
<p>In the end Skippy&rsquo;s fearless
honesty and loyalty bring happy
freedom to himself and his best
pal&mdash;his father.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
